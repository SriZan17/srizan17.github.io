We will have succeeded if, after the confusion and tumult, we manage at last to be as it already is. To put it at its grandest, calm is the meaning of life. By which is meant that calm is the thing to which everything else should ultimately contribute and the measure by which it should be justified. Plenty of things are important and notable: money, friends, art, work, but if we probe hard at why they matter, if we push upstream, we eventually find that it's because of their power to contribute to something else, to what the Romans poetically knew as the 'summum bonum, the highest of all goods; a steady unruffled peaceful state of mind. That calm ocean is calling to us; it should elicit in us an ache, and a sadness. It's where we belong but have spent so little time in until now.

        "\"Why did Marx and Lenin succeed where Hong and the Mahdi failed? Not because socialist humanism was philosophically more sophisticated than Islamic and Christian theology, but rather because Marx and Lenin devoted more attention to understanding the technological and economic realities of their time than to perusing ancient texts and prophetic dreams. Steam engines, railroads, telegraphs and electricity created unheard-of problems as well as unprecedented opportunities. The experiences, needs and hopes of the new class of urban proletariats were simply too different from those of biblical peasants. To answer these needs and hopes, Marx and Lenin studied how a steam engine functions, how a coal mine operates, how railroads shape the economy and how electricity influences politics.\nLenin was once asked to define communism in a single sentence. \u2018Communism is power to worker councils,\u2019 he said, \u2018plus electrification of the whole country.\u2019 There can be no communism without electricity, without railroads, without radio. You couldn\u2019t establish a communist regime in sixteenth-century Russia, because communism necessitates the concentration of information and resources in one hub. \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u2019 only works when produce can easily be collected and distributed across vast distances, and when activities can be monitored and coordinated over entire countries.\n\nMarx and his followers understood the new technological realities and the new human experiences, so they had relevant answers to the new problems of industrial society, as well as original ideas about how to benefit from the unprecedented opportunities. The socialists created a brave new religion for a brave new world. They promised salvation through technology and economics, thus establishing the first techno-religion in history, and changing the foundations of ideological discourse. Before Marx, people defined and divided themselves according to their views about God, not about production methods. Since Marx, questions of technology and economic structure became far more important and divisive than debates about the soul and the afterlife. In the second half of the twentieth century, humankind almost obliterated itself in an argument about production methods. Even the harshest critics of Marx and Lenin adopted their basic attitude towards history and society, and began thinking about technology and production much more carefully than about God and heaven.\"",

Throughout history, disciplined armies easily routed disorganised hordes, and unified elites dominated the disorderly masses. In 1914, for example, 3 million Russian noblemen, officials and business people lorded it over 180 million peasants and workers. The Russian elite knew how to cooperate in defence of its common interests, whereas the 180 million commoners were incapable of effective mobilisation. Indeed, much of the elite\u2019s efforts focused on ensuring that the 180 million people at the bottom would never learn to cooperate.\n\nIn order to mount a revolution, numbers are never enough.

In 1917, at a time when the Russian upper and middle classes numbered at least 3 million people, the Communist Party had just 23,000 members. 19 The communists nevertheless gained control of the vast Russian Empire because they organised themselves well.

        "\"Some 2,300 years ago Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy.\nA couple of centuries earlier Buddha had made an even more radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering. Such sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them, we don\u2019t react to them with contentment; rather, we just crave for more. Hence no matter how many blissful or exciting sensations I may experience, they will never satisfy me.\n\nThis Buddhist view of happiness has a lot in common with the biochemical view. Both agree that pleasant sensations disappear as fast as they arise, and that as long as people crave pleasant sensations without actually experiencing them, they remain dissatisfied. However, this problem has two very different solutions. The biochemical solution is to develop products and treatments that will provide humans with an unending stream of pleasant sensations, so we will never be without them. The Buddha\u2019s suggestion was to reduce our craving for pleasant sensations, and not allow them to control our lives. According to Buddha, we can train our minds to observe carefully how all sensations constantly arise and pass. When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are \u2013 ephemeral and meaningless vibrations \u2013 we lose interest in pursuing them. For what is the point of running after something that disappears as fast as it arises? At present, humankind has far greater interest in the biochemical solution. No matter what monks in their Himalayan caves or philosophers in their ivory towers say, for the capitalist juggernaut, happiness is pleasure. Period. With each passing year our tolerance for unpleasant sensations decreases, and our craving for pleasant sensations increases. Both scientific research and economic activity are geared to that end, each year producing better painkillers, new ice-cream flavours, more comfortable mattresses, and more addictive games for our smartphones, so that we will not suffer a single boring moment while waiting for the bus. All this is hardly enough, of course. Since Homo sapiens was not adapted by evolution to experience constant pleasure, if that is what humankind nevertheless wants, ice cream and smartphone games will not do. It will be necessary to change our biochemistry and re-engineer our bodies and minds. So we are working on that. You may debate whether it is good or bad, but it seems that the second great project of the twenty-first century \u2013 to ensure global happiness \u2013 will involve re-engineering Homo sapiens so that it can enjoy everlasting pleasure.\"",

One of them gets $100, which he must divide between himself and the other participant in any way he wants. He may keep everything, split the money in half or give most of it away. The other player can do one of two things: accept the suggested division, or reject it outright. If he rejects the division, nobody gets anything. Classical economic theories maintain that humans are rational calculating machines. They propose that most people will keep $99, and offer $1 to the other participant. They further propose that the other participant will accept the offer. A rational person offered a dollar will always say yes. What does he care if the other player gets $99? Classical economists have probably never left their laboratories and lecture halls to venture into the real world. Most people playing the Ultimatum Game reject very low offers because they are \u2018unfair\u2019. They prefer losing a dollar to looking like suckers. Since this is how the real world functions, few people make very low offers in the first place. Most people divide the money equally, or give themselves only a moderate advantage, offering $30 or $40 to the other player.

And suppose even after making a decision, Romeo could always retract and make a different choice instead. What kind of play would it have been? Well, that\u2019s the play technological progress is trying to produce for us. When our desires make us uncomfortable, technology promises to bail us out. When the nail on which the entire universe hangs is pegged in a problematic spot, technology would pull it out and stick it somewhere else. But where exactly? If I could peg that nail anywhere in the cosmos, where should I peg it, and why there of all places? Humanist dramas unfold when people have uncomfortable desires. For example, it is extremely uncomfortable when Romeo of the house of Montague falls in love with Juliet of the house of Capulet, because the Montagues and Capulets are bitter enemies. The technological solution to such dramas is to make sure we never have uncomfortable desires. How much pain and sorrow would have been avoided if instead of drinking poison, Romeo and Juliet could just take a pill or wear a helmet that would have redirected their star-crossed love towards other people.\"",
        "\"The Data Religion - 2\nHistory in a Nutshell\n\nFrom a Dataist perspective, we may interpret the entire human species as a single data-processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips. If so, we can also understand the whole of history as a process of improving the efficiency of this system, through four basic methods:\n\n1\\. Increasing the number of processors. A city of 100,000 people has more computing power than a village of 1,000 people.\n\n2\\. Increasing the variety of processors. Different processors may use diverse ways to calculate and analyse data. Using several kinds of processors in a single system may therefore increase its dynamism and creativity. A conversation between a peasant, a priest and a physician may produce novel ideas that would never emerge from a conversation between three hunter-gatherers.\n\n3\\. Increasing the number of connections between processors. There is little point in increasing the mere number and variety of processors if they are poorly connected to each other. A trade network linking ten cities is likely to result in many more economic, technological and social innovations than ten isolated cities.\n\n4\\. Increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. Connecting processors is hardly useful if data cannot flow freely. Just building roads between ten cities won\u2019t be very useful if they are plagued by robbers, or if some autocratic despot doesn\u2019t allow merchants and travellers to move as they wish.\n\nThese four methods often contradict one another. The greater the number and variety of processors, the harder it is to freely connect them. The construction of the Sapiens data-processing system accordingly passed through four main stages, each characterised by an emphasis on different methods. The first stage began with the Cognitive Revolution, which made it possible to connect unlimited numbers of Sapiens into a single data-processing network. This gave Sapiens a crucial advantage over all other human and animal species. While there is a strict limit to the number of Neanderthals, chimpanzees or elephants you can connect to the same net, there is no limit to the number of Sapiens. Sapiens used their advantage in data processing to overrun the entire world. However, as they spread into different lands and climates they lost touch with one another, and underwent diverse cultural transformations. The result was an immense variety of human cultures, each with its own lifestyle, behaviour patterns and world view. Hence the first phase of history involved an increase in the number and variety of human processors, at the expense of connectivity: 20,000 years ago there were many more Sapiens than 70,000 years ago, and Sapiens in Europe processed information differently to Sapiens in China. However, there were no connections between people in Europe and China, and it would have seemed utterly impossible that all Sapiens may one day be part of a single data-processing web. The second stage began with the Agricultural Revolution and continued until the invention of writing and money about 5,000 years ago. Agriculture speeded demographic growth, so the number of human processors rose sharply. Simultaneously, agriculture enabled many more people to live together in the same place, thereby generating dense local networks that contained an unprecedented number of processors. In addition, agriculture created new incentives and opportunities for different networks to trade and communicate with one another. Nevertheless, during the second phase centrifugal forces remained predominant. In the absence of writing and money, humans could not establish cities, kingdoms or empires. Humankind was still divided into innumerable little tribes, each with its own lifestyle and world view. Uniting the whole of humankind was not even a fantasy. The third stage kicked off with the invention of writing and money about 5,000 years ago, and lasted until the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Thanks to writing and money, the gravitational field of human cooperation finally overpowered the centrifugal forces. Human groups bonded and merged to form cities and kingdoms. Political and commercial links between different cities and kingdoms also tightened. At least since the first millennium BC \u2013 when coinage, empires and universal religions appeared \u2013 humans began to consciously dream about forging a single network that would encompass the entire globe. This dream became a reality during the fourth and last stage of history, which began around 1492. Early modern explorers, conquerors and traders wove the first thin threads that encompassed the whole world. In the late modern period these threads were made stronger and denser, so that the spider\u2019s web of Columbus\u2019s days became the steel and asphalt grid of the twenty-first century. Even more importantly, information was allowed to flow increasingly freely along this global grid. When Columbus first hooked up the Eurasian net to the American net, only a few bits of data could cross the ocean each year, running the gauntlet of cultural prejudices, strict censorship and political repression. But as the years went by, the free market, the scientific community, the rule of law and the spread of democracy all helped to lift the barriers. We often imagine that democracy and the free market won because they were \u2018good\u2019. In truth, they won because they improved the global data-processing system. So over the last 70,000 years humankind first spread out, then separated into distinct groups, and finally merged again. Yet the process of unification did not take us back to the beginning. When the different human groups fused into the global village of today, each brought along its unique legacy of thoughts, tools and behaviours, which it collected and developed along the way. Our modern larders are now stuffed with Middle Eastern wheat, Andean potatoes, New Guinean sugar and Ethiopian coffee. Similarly, our language, religion, music and politics are replete with heirlooms from across the planet. 5 If humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, what is its output? Dataists would say that its output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.\n\nInformation Wants to be Free\n\nLike capitalism, Dataism too began as a neutral scientific theory, but is now mutating into a religion that claims to determine right and wrong. The supreme value of this new religion is \u2018information flow\u2019. If life is the movement of information, and if we think that life is good, it follows that we should extend, deepen and spread the flow of information in the universe. According to Dataism, human experiences are not sacred and Homo sapiens isn\u2019t the apex of creation or a precursor of some future Homo deus. Humans are merely tools for creating the Internet-of-All-Things, which may eventually spread out from planet Earth to cover the whole galaxy and even the whole universe. This cosmic data- processing system would be like God. It will be everywhere and will control everything, and humans are destined to merge into it. This vision is reminiscent of some traditional religious visions. Thus Hindus believe that humans can and should merge into the universal soul of the cosmos \u2013 the atman. Christians believe that after death saints are filled by the infinite grace of God, whereas sinners cut themselves off from His presence. Indeed, in Silicon Valley the Dataist prophets consciously use traditional messianic language. For example, Ray Kurzweil\u2019s book of prophecies is called The Singularity is Near, echoing John the Baptist\u2019s cry: \u2018the kingdom of heaven is near\u2019 (Matthew 3:2). Dataists explain to those who still worship flesh-and-blood mortals that they are overly attached to outdated technology. Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm. After all, what\u2019s the advantage of humans over chickens? Only that in humans information flows in much more complex patterns than in chickens. Humans absorb more data, and process it using better algorithms. (In day-to\u0002day language that means that humans allegedly have deeper emotions and superior intellectual abilities. But remember that according to current biological dogma, emotions and intelligence are just algorithms.) Well then, if we could create a data-processing system that absorbs even more data than a human being, and that processes it even more efficiently, wouldn\u2019t that system be superior to a human in exactly the same way that a human is superior to a chicken? Dataism isn\u2019t limited to idle prophecies. Like every religion, it has its practical commandments. First and foremost, a Dataist ought to maximise data flow by connecting to more and more media, and producing and consuming more and more information. Like other successful religions, Dataism is also missionary. Its second commandment is to connect everything to the system, including heretics who don\u2019t want to be connected. And \u2018everything\u2019 means more than just humans. It means every thing. My body, of course, but also the cars on the street, the refrigerators in the kitchen, the chickens in their coop and the trees in the jungle \u2013 all should be connected to the Internet-of-All-Things. The refrigerator will monitor the number of eggs in the drawer, and inform the chicken coop when a new shipment is needed. The cars will talk with one another, and the trees in the jungle will report on the weather and on carbon dioxide levels. We mustn\u2019t leave any part of the universe disconnected from the great web of life. Conversely, the greatest sin is to block the data flow. What is death, if not a situation when information doesn\u2019t flow? Hence Dataism upholds the freedom of information as the greatest good of all. People rarely manage to come up with a completely new value. The last time this happened was in the eighteenth century, when the humanist revolution preached the stirring ideals of human liberty, human equality and human fraternity. Since 1789, despite numerous wars, revolutions and upheavals, humans have not managed to come up with any new value. All subsequent conflicts and struggles have been conducted either in the name of the three humanist values, or in the name of even older values such as obeying God or serving the nation. Dataism is the first movement since 1789 that created a really novel value: freedom of information. We mustn\u2019t confuse freedom of information with the old liberal ideal of freedom of expression. Freedom of expression was given to humans, and protected their right to think and say what they wished \u2013 including their right to keep their mouths shut and their thoughts to themselves. Freedom of information, in contrast, is not given to humans. It is given to information. Moreover, this novel value may impinge on the traditional freedom of expression, by privileging the right of information to circulate freely over the right of humans to own data and to restrict its movement. On 11 January 2013, Dataism got its first martyr when Aaron Swartz, a twenty-six-year-old American hacker, committed suicide in his apartment. Swartz was a rare genius. At fourteen, he helped develop the crucial RSS protocol. Swartz was also a firm believer in the freedom of information. In 2008 he published the \u2018Guerilla Open Access Manifesto\u2019 that demanded a free and unlimited flow of information. Swartz said that \u2018We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that\u2019s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.\u2019 Swartz was as good as his word. He became annoyed with the JSTOR digital library for charging its customers. JSTOR holds millions of scientific papers and studies, and believes in the freedom of expression of scientists and journal editors, which includes the freedom to charge a fee for reading their articles. According to JSTOR, if I want to get paid for the ideas I created, it\u2019s my right to do so. Swartz thought otherwise. He believed that information wants to be free, that ideas don\u2019t belong to the people who created them, and that it is wrong to lock data behind walls and charge money for entrance. He used the MIT computer network to access JSTOR, and downloaded hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, which he intended to release onto the Internet, so that everybody could read them freely. Swartz was arrested and put on trial. When he realised he would probably be convicted and sent to jail, he hanged himself. Hackers reacted with petitions and attacks directed at the academic and governmental institutions that persecuted Swartz and that infringe on the freedom of information. Under pressure, JSTOR apologised for its part in the tragedy, and today allows free access to much of its data (though not to all of it). 6 To convince sceptics, Dataist missionaries repeatedly explain the immense benefits of the freedom of information. Just as capitalists believe that all good things depend on economic growth, so Dataists believe all good things \u2013 including economic growth \u2013 depend on the freedom of information. Why did the USA grow faster than the USSR? Because information flowed more freely in the USA. Why are Americans healthier, wealthier and happier than Iranians or Nigerians? Thanks to the freedom of information. So if we want to create a better world, the key is to set the data free. We have already seen that Google can detect new epidemics faster than traditional health organisations, but only if we allow it free access to the information we are producing. A free data flow can similarly reduce pollution and waste, for example by rationalising the transportation system. In 2010 the number of private cars in the world exceeded 1 billion, and it has since kept growing. 7 These cars pollute the planet and waste enormous resources, not least by necessitating ever wider roads and parking spaces. People have become so used to the convenience of private transport that they are unlikely to settle for buses and trains. However, Dataists point out that people really want mobility rather than a private car, and a good data-processing system can provide this mobility far more cheaply and efficiently. I have a private car, but most of the time it sits idly in the car park. On a typical day, I enter my car at 8:04, and drive for half an hour to the university, where I park my car for the day. At 18:11 I come back to the car, drive half an hour back home, and that\u2019s it. So I am using my car for just an hour a day. Why do I need to keep it for the other twenty-three hours? We can create a smart car\u0002pool system, run by computer algorithms. The computer would know that I need to leave home at 8:04, and would route the nearest autonomous car to pick me up at that precise moment. After dropping me off at campus, it would be available for other uses instead of waiting in the car park. At 18:11 sharp, as I leave the university gate, another communal car would stop right in front of me, and take me home. In such a way, 50 million communal autonomous cars may replace 1 billion private cars, and we would also need far fewer roads, bridges, tunnels and parking spaces. Provided, of course, I renounce my privacy and allow the algorithms to always know where I am and where I want to go.\"",
        "\"When Epicurus defined happiness as the supreme good, he warned his disciples that it is hard work to be happy.\nMaterial achievements alone will not satisfy us for long.

Epicurus was apparently on to something. Being happy doesn\u2019t come easy. Despite our unprecedented achievements in the last few decades, it is far from obvious that contemporary people are significantly more satisfied than their ancestors in bygone years.

        "\"This is the paradox of historical knowledge. Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. But knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance.\nThe more data we have and the better we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge becomes outdated. Centuries ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a leisurely pace too. Today our knowledge is increasing at breakneck speed, and theoretically we should understand the world better and better. But the very opposite is happening. Our new-found knowledge leads to faster economic, social and political changes; in an attempt to understand what is happening, we accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, which leads only to faster and greater upheavals. Consequently we are less and less able to make sense of the present or forecast the future. In 1016 it was relatively easy to predict how Europe would look in 1050. Sure, dynasties might fall, unknown raiders might invade, and natural disasters might strike; yet it was clear that in 1050 Europe would still be ruled by kings and priests, that it would be an agricultural society, that most of its inhabitants would be peasants, and that it would continue to suffer greatly from famines, plagues and wars. In contrast, in 2016 we have no idea how Europe will look in 2050. We cannot say what kind of political system it will have, how its job market will be structured, or even what kind of bodies its inhabitants will possess.\"",

        "\"Meaning is created when many people weave together a common network of stories. Why does a particular action \u2013 such as getting married in church, fasting on Ramadan or voting on election day \u2013 seem meaningful to me?\nBecause my parents also think it is meaningful, as do my brothers, my neighbours, people in nearby cities and even the residents of far-off countries. And why do all these people think it is meaningful? Because their friends and neighbours also share the same view. People constantly reinforce each other\u2019s beliefs in a self-perpetuating loop. Each round of mutual confirmation tightens the web of meaning further, until you have little choice but to believe what everyone else believes. Yet over decades and centuries the web of meaning unravels and a new web is spun in its place. To study history means to watch the spinning and unravelling of these webs, and to realise that what seems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their descendants.\n\nIn 1187 Saladin defeated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin and conquered Jerusalem. In response the Pope launched the Third Crusade to recapture the holy city. Imagine a young English nobleman named John, who left home to fight Saladin. John believed that his actions had an objective meaning. He believed that if he died on the crusade, after death his soul would ascend to heaven, where it would enjoy everlasting celestial joy. He would have been horrified to learn that the soul and heaven are just stories invented by humans. John wholeheartedly believed that if he reached the Holy Land, and if some Muslim warrior with a big moustache brought an axe down on his head, he would feel an unbearable pain, his ears would ring, his legs would crumble under him, his field of vision would turn black \u2013 and the very next moment he would see brilliant light all around him, he would hear angelic voices and melodious harps, and radiant winged cherubs would beckon him through a magnificent golden gate.\n\nJohn had a very strong faith in all this, because he was enmeshed within an extremely dense and powerful web of meaning. His earliest memories were of Grandpa Henry\u2019s rusty sword, hanging in the castle\u2019s main hall. Ever since he was a toddler John had heard stories of Grandpa Henry who died on the Second Crusade and who is now resting with the angels in heaven, watching over John and his family. When minstrels visited the castle, they usually sang about the brave crusaders who fought in the Holy Land. When John went to church, he enjoyed looking at the stained-glass windows. One showed Godfrey of Bouillon riding a horse and impaling a wicked-looking Muslim on his lance. Another showed the souls of sinners burning in hell. John listened attentively to the local priest, the most learned man he knew. Almost every Sunday, the priest explained \u2013 with the help of well-crafted parables and hilarious jokes \u2013 that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church, that the Pope in Rome was our holy father and that we always had to obey his commands. If we murdered or stole, God would send us to hell; but if we killed infidel Muslims, God would welcome us to heaven. One day when John was just turning eighteen a dishevelled knight rode to the castle\u2019s gate, and in a choked voice announced the news: Saladin has destroyed the crusader army at Hattin! Jerusalem has fallen! The Pope has declared a new crusade, promising eternal salvation to anyone who dies on it! All around, people looked shocked and worried, but John\u2019s face lit up in an otherworldly glow and he proclaimed: \u2018I am going to fight the infidels and liberate the Holy Land!\u2019 Everyone fell silent for a moment, and then smiles and tears appeared on their faces. His mother wiped her eyes, gave John a big hug and told him how proud she was of him. His father gave him a mighty pat on the back, and said: \u2018If only I was your age, son, I would join you. Our family\u2019s honour is at stake \u2013 I am sure you won\u2019t disappoint us!\u2019 Two of his friends announced that they were coming too. Even John\u2019s sworn rival, the baron on the other side of the river, paid a visit to wish him Godspeed.\n\nAs he left the castle, villagers came forth from their hovels to wave to him, and all the pretty girls looked longingly at the brave crusader setting off to fight the infidels. When he set sail from England and made his way through strange and distant lands \u2013 Normandy, Provence, Sicily \u2013 he was joined by bands of foreign knights, all with the same destination and the same faith. When the army finally disembarked in the Holy Land and waged battle with Saladin\u2019s hosts, John was amazed to discover that even the wicked Saracens shared his beliefs. True, they were a bit confused, thinking that the Christians were the infidels and that the Muslims were obeying God\u2019s will. Yet they too accepted the basic principle that those fighting for God and Jerusalem will go straight to heaven when they die. In such a way, thread by thread, medieval civilisation spun its web of meaning, trapping John and his contemporaries like flies. It was inconceivable to John that all these stories were just figments of the imagination. Maybe his parents and uncles were wrong. But the minstrels too, and all his friends, and the village girls, the learned priest, the baron on the other side of the river, the Pope in Rome, the Proven\u00e7al and Sicilian knights, and even the very Muslims \u2013 is it possible that they were all hallucinating?\n\nAnd the years pass. As the historian watches, the web of meaning unravels and another is spun in its stead. John\u2019s parents die, followed by all his siblings and friends. Instead of minstrels singing about the crusades, the new fashion is stage plays about tragic love affairs. The family castle burns to the ground and, when it is rebuilt, no trace is found of Grandpa Henry\u2019s sword. The church windows shatter in a winter storm and the replacement glass no longer depicts Godfrey of Bouillon and the sinners in hell, but rather the great triumph of the king of England over the king of France. The local priest has stopped calling the Pope \u2018our holy father\u2019 \u2013 he is now referred to as \u2018that devil in Rome\u2019. In the nearby university scholars pore over ancient Greek manuscripts, dissect dead bodies and whisper quietly behind closed doors that perhaps there is no such thing as the soul. And the years continue to pass. Where the castle once stood, there is now a shopping mall. In the local cinema they are screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the umpteenth time. In an empty church a bored vicar is overjoyed to see two Japanese tourists. He explains at length about the stained-glass windows, while they politely smile, nodding in complete incomprehension. On the steps outside a gaggle of teenagers are playing with their iPhones. They watch a new YouTube remix of John Lennon\u2019s \u2018Imagine\u2019. \u2018Imagine there\u2019s no heaven,\u2019 sings Lennon, \u2018it\u2019s easy if you try.\u2019 A Pakistani street cleaner is sweeping the pavement, while a nearby radio broadcasts the news: the carnage in Syria continues, and the Security Council\u2019s meeting has ended in an impasse. Suddenly a hole in time opens, a mysterious ray of light illuminates the face of one of the teenagers, who announces: \u2018I am going to fight the infidels and liberate the Holy Land!\u2019\n\nInfidels and Holy Land? These words no longer carry any meaning for most people in today\u2019s England. Even the vicar would probably think the teenager is having some sort of psychotic episode. In contrast, if an English youth decided to join Amnesty International and travel to Syria to protect the human rights of refugees, he will be seen as a hero. In the Middle Ages people would have thought he had gone bonkers. Nobody in twelfth-century England knew what human rights were. You want to travel to the Middle East and risk your life not in order to kill Muslims, but to protect one group of Muslims from another? You must be out of your mind. That\u2019s how history unfolds. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously. With hindsight, going on crusade in the hope of reaching Paradise sounds like utter madness. With hindsight, the Cold War seems even madder. How come thirty years ago people were willing to risk nuclear holocaust because of their belief in a communist paradise? A hundred years hence, our belief in democracy and human rights might look equally incomprehensible to our descendants.\"",

This never happened, because as old professions became obsolete, new professions evolved, and there was always something humans could do better than machines.\nYet this is not a law of nature, and nothing guarantees it will continue to be like that in the future. Humans have two basic types of abilities: physical abilities and cognitive abilities. As long as machines competed with us merely in physical abilities, you could always find cognitive tasks that humans do better. So machines took over purely manual jobs, while humans focused on jobs requiring at least some cognitive skills.

        "\"Just as the gap between religion and science is smaller than we commonly think, so the gap between religion and spirituality is much bigger. Religion is a deal, whereas spirituality is a journey.\nReligion gives a complete description of the world, and offers us a well-defined contract with predetermined goals. \u2018God exists. He told us to behave in certain ways. If you obey God, you\u2019ll be admitted to heaven. If you disobey Him, you\u2019ll burn in hell.\u2019 The very clarity of this deal allows society to define common norms and values that regulate human behaviour. Spiritual journeys are nothing like that. They usually take people in mysterious ways towards unknown destinations. The quest usually begins with some big question, such as who am I? What is the meaning of life? What is good? Whereas many people just accept the ready-made answers provided by the powers that be, spiritual seekers are not so easily satisfied. They are determined to follow the big question wherever it leads, and not just to places you know well or wish to visit.\n\nSuch journeys are fundamentally different from religions, because religions seek to cement the worldly order whereas spirituality seeks to escape it. Often enough, the most important demand from spiritual wanderers is to challenge the beliefs and conventions of dominant religions. In Zen Buddhism it is said that \u2018If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.\u2019 Which means that if while walking on the spiritual path you encounter the rigid ideas and fixed laws of institutionalised Buddhism, you must free yourself from them too.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the spiritual journey is always tragic, for it is a lonely path fit for individuals rather than for entire societies. Human cooperation requires firm answers rather than just questions, and those who foam against stultified religious structures end up forging new structures in their place. It happened to the dualists, whose spiritual journeys became religious establishments. It happened to Martin Luther, who after challenging the laws, institutions and rituals of the Catholic Church found himself writing new law books, founding new institutions and inventing new ceremonies. It happened even to Buddha and Jesus. In their uncompromising quest for the truth they subverted the laws, rituals and structures of traditional Hinduism and Judaism. But eventually more laws, more rituals and more structures were created in their name than in the name of any other person in history.\"",

        "\"The Data Religion - 3\nBut maybe you don\u2019t need convincing, especially if you are under twenty. People just want to be part of the data flow, even if that means giving up their privacy, their autonomy and their individuality. Humanist art sanctifies the individual genius, and a Picasso doodle on a napkin nets millions at Sotheby\u2019s. Humanist science glorifies the individual researcher, and every scholar dreams of putting his or her name at the top of a Science or Nature paper. But a growing number of artistic and scientific creations are nowadays produced by the ceaseless collaboration of \u2018everyone\u2019. Who writes Wikipedia? All of us. The individual is becoming a tiny chip inside a giant system that nobody really understands. Every day I absorb countless data bits through emails, phone calls and articles; process the data; and transmit back new bits through more emails, phone calls and articles. I don\u2019t really know where I fit into the great scheme of things, and how my bits of data connect with the bits produced by billions of other humans and computers. I don\u2019t have time to find out, because I am too busy answering all the emails. And as I process more data more efficiently \u2013 answering more emails, making more phone calls and writing more articles \u2013 so the people around me are flooded by even more data. This relentless flow of data sparks new inventions and disruptions that nobody plans, controls or comprehends. No one understands how the global economy functions or where global politics is heading. But no one needs to understand. All you need to do is answer your emails faster \u2013 and allow the system to read them. Just as free-market capitalists believe in the invisible hand of the market, so Dataists believe in the invisible hand of the data flow. As the global data-processing system becomes all-knowing and all-powerful, so connecting to the system becomes the source of all meaning. Humans want to merge into the data flow because when you are part of the data flow you are part of something much bigger than yourself. Traditional religions told you that your every word and action was part of some great cosmic plan, and that God watched you every minute and cared about all your thoughts and feelings. Data religion now says that your every word and action is part of the great data flow, that the algorithms are constantly watching you and that they care about everything you do and feel. Most people like this very much. For true-believers, to be disconnected from the data flow risks losing the very meaning of life. What\u2019s the point of doing or experiencing anything if nobody knows about it, and if it doesn\u2019t contribute something to the global exchange of information? Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not \u2013 indeed cannot \u2013 find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do. Twenty years ago Japanese tourists were a universal laughing stock because they always carried cameras and took pictures of everything in sight. Now everyone is doing it. If you go to India and see an elephant, you don\u2019t look at the elephant and ask yourself, \u2018What do I feel?\u2019 \u2013 you are too busy looking for your smartphone, taking a picture of the elephant, posting it on Facebook and then checking your account every two minutes to see how many Likes you got. Writing a private diary \u2013 a common humanist practice in previous generations \u2013 sounds to many present\u0002day youngsters utterly pointless. Why write anything if nobody else can read it? The new motto says: \u2018If you experience something \u2013 record it. If you record something \u2013 upload it. If you upload something \u2013 share it.\u2019 Throughout this book we have repeatedly asked what makes humans superior to other animals. Dataism has a new and simple answer. In themselves, human experiences are not superior at all to the experiences of wolves or elephants. One bit of data is as good as another. However, a human can write a poem about his experience and post it online, thereby enriching the global data\u0002processing system. That makes his bits count. A wolf cannot do this. Hence all of the wolf\u2019s experiences \u2013 as deep and complex as they may be \u2013 are worthless. No wonder we are so busy converting our experiences into data. It isn\u2019t a question of trendiness. It is a question of survival. We must prove to ourselves and to the system that we still have value. And value lies not in having experiences, but in turning these experiences into free-flowing data.\n\nKnow Thyself\n\nDataism is neither liberal nor humanist. It should be emphasised, however, that Dataism isn\u2019t anti-humanist. It has nothing against human experiences. It just doesn\u2019t think they are intrinsically valuable. When we surveyed the three main humanist sects, we asked which experience is the most valuable: listening to Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony, to Chuck Berry, to a pygmy initiation song or to the howl of a wolf in heat. A Dataist would argue that the entire exercise is misguided, because music should be evaluated according to the data it carries rather than according to the experience it creates. A Dataist may argue, for example, that the Fifth Symphony carries far more data than the pygmy initiation song, because it uses more chords and scales, and creates dialogues with many more musical styles. Consequently, you need far more computational power to decipher the Fifth Symphony, and you gain far more knowledge from doing so. Music, according to this view, is mathematical patterns. Mathematics can describe every musical piece, as well as the relations between any two pieces. Hence you can measure the precise data value of every symphony, song and howl, and determine which is the richest. The experiences they create in humans or wolves don\u2019t really matter. True, for the last 70,000 years or so, human experiences have been the most efficient data-processing algorithms in the universe, hence there was good reason to sanctify them. However, we may soon reach a point when these algorithms will be superseded, and even become a burden. Sapiens evolved in the African savannah tens of thousands of years ago, and their algorithms are just not built to handle twenty-first-century data flows. We might try to upgrade the human data-processing system, but this may not be enough. The Internet-of-All-Things may soon create such huge and rapid data flows that even upgraded human algorithms cannot handle it. When the car replaced the horse-drawn carriage, we didn\u2019t upgrade the horses \u2013 we retired them. Perhaps it is time to do the same with Homo sapiens. Dataism adopts a strictly functional approach to humanity, appraising the value of human experiences according to their function in data-processing mechanisms. If we develop an algorithm that fulfils the same function better, human experiences will lose their value. Thus if we can replace not just taxi drivers and doctors but also lawyers, poets and musicians with superior computer programs, why should we care if these programs have no consciousness and no subjective experiences? If some humanist starts adulating the sacredness of human experience, Dataists would dismiss such sentimental humbug. \u2018The experience you praise is just an outdated biochemical algorithm. In the African savannah 70,000 years ago, that algorithm was state\u0002of-the-art. Even in the twentieth century it was vital for the army and for the economy. But soon we will have much better algorithms.\u2019 In the climactic scene of many Hollywood science-fiction movies, humans face an alien invasion fleet, an army of rebellious robots or an all-knowing super- computer that wants to obliterate them. Humanity seems doomed. But at the very last moment, against all the odds, humanity triumphs thanks to something that the aliens, the robots and the super-computers didn\u2019t suspect and cannot fathom: love. The hero, who up till now has been easily manipulated by the super-computer and has been riddled with bullets by the evil robots, is inspired by his sweetheart to make a completely unexpected move that turns the tables on the thunderstruck Matrix. Dataism finds such scenarios utterly ridiculous. \u2018Come on,\u2019 it admonishes the Hollywood screenwriters, \u2018is that all you could come up with? Love? And not even some platonic cosmic love, but the carnal attraction between two mammals? Do you really think that an all-knowing super\u0002computer or aliens who managed to conquer the entire galaxy would be dumbfounded by a hormonal rush?\u2019 By equating the human experience with data patterns, Dataism undermines our main source of authority and meaning, and heralds a tremendous religious revolution, the like of which has not been seen since the eighteenth century. In the days of Locke, Hume and Voltaire humanists argued that \u2018God is a product of the human imagination\u2019. Dataism now gives humanists a taste of their own medicine, and tells them: \u2018Yes, God is a product of the human imagination, but human imagination in turn is the product of biochemical algorithms.\u2019 In the eighteenth century, humanism sidelined God by shifting from a deo-centric to a homo-centric world view. In the twenty-first century, Dataism may sideline humans by shifting from a homo-centric to a data-centric view. The Dataist revolution will probably take a few decades, if not a century or two. But then the humanist revolution too did not happen overnight. At first, humans kept on believing in God, and argued that humans are sacred because they were created by God for some divine purpose. Only much later did some people dare say that humans are sacred in their own right, and that God doesn\u2019t exist at all. Similarly, today most Dataists say that the Internet-of-All-Things is sacred because humans are creating it to serve human needs. But eventually, the Internet-of-All-Things may become sacred in its own right. The shift from a homo-centric to a data-centric world view won\u2019t be merely a philosophical revolution. It will be a practical revolution. All truly important revolutions are practical. The humanist idea that \u2018humans invented God\u2019 was significant because it had far-reaching practical implications. Similarly, the Dataist idea that \u2018organisms are algorithms\u2019 is significant due to its day-to-day practical consequences. Ideas change the world only when they change our behaviour. In ancient Babylon, when people faced a difficult dilemma they climbed to the top of the local temple in the darkness of night and observed the sky. The Babylonians believed that the stars control our fate and predict our future. By watching the stars the Babylonians decided whether to get married, plough the field and go to war. Their philosophical beliefs were translated into very practical procedures. Scriptural religions such as Judaism and Christianity told a different story: \u2018The stars are lying. God, who created the stars, revealed the entire truth in the Bible. So stop observing the stars \u2013 read the Bible instead!\u2019 This too was a practical recommendation. When people didn\u2019t know whom to marry, what career to choose and whether to start a war, they read the Bible and followed its counsel. Next came the humanists, with an altogether new story: \u2018Humans invented God, wrote the Bible and then interpreted it in a thousand different ways. So humans themselves are the source of all truth. You may read the Bible as an inspiring human creation, but you don\u2019t have to. If you are facing any dilemma, just listen to yourself and follow your inner voice.\u2019 Humanism then gave detailed practical instructions on how to listen to yourself, recommending things such as watching sunsets, reading Goethe, keeping a private diary, having heart-to\u0002heart talks with a good friend and holding democratic elections. For centuries scientists too accepted these humanist guidelines. When physicists wondered whether to get married or not, they too watched sunsets and tried to get in touch with themselves. When chemists contemplated whether to accept a problematic job offer, they too wrote diaries and had heart-to-heart talks with a good friend. When biologists debated whether to wage war or sign a peace treaty, they too voted in democratic elections. When brain scientists wrote books about their startling discoveries, they often put an inspiring Goethe quote on the first page. This was the basis for the modern alliance between science and humanism, which kept the delicate balance between the modern yang and the modern yin \u2013 between reason and emotion, between the laboratory and the museum, between the production line and the supermarket. The scientists not only sanctified human feelings, but also found an excellent evolutionary reason to do so. After Darwin, biologists began explaining that feelings are complex algorithms honed by evolution to help animals make the right decisions. Our love, our fear and our passion aren\u2019t some nebulous spiritual phenomena good only for composing poetry. Rather, they encapsulate millions of years of practical wisdom. When you read the Bible, you get advice from a few priests and rabbis who lived in ancient Jerusalem. In contrast, when you listen to your feelings, you follow an algorithm that evolution has developed for millions of years, and that withstood the harshest quality tests of natural selection. Your feelings are the voice of millions of ancestors, each of whom managed to survive and reproduce in an unforgiving environment. Your feelings are not infallible, of course, but they are better than most alternatives. For millions upon millions of years, feelings were the best algorithms in the world. Hence in the days of Confucius, of Muhammad or of Stalin, people should have listened to their feelings rather than to the teachings of Confucianism, Islam or communism. Yet in the twenty-first century, feelings are no longer the best algorithms in the world. We are developing superior algorithms which utilise unprecedented computing power and giant databases. The Google and Facebook algorithms not only know exactly how you feel, they also know a million other things about you that you hardly suspect. Consequently you should now stop listening to your feelings, and start listening to these external algorithms instead. What\u2019s the use of having democratic elections when the algorithms know how each person is going to vote, and when they also know the exact neurological reasons why one person votes Democrat while another votes Republican? Whereas humanism commanded: \u2018Listen to your feelings!\u2019 Dataism now commands: \u2018Listen to the algorithms! They know how you feel.\u2019 When you contemplate whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war, Dataism tells you it would be a total waste of time to climb a high mountain and watch the sun setting on the waves. It would be equally pointless to go to a museum, write a private diary or have a heart-to-heart talk with a friend. Yes, in order to make the right decisions you must get to know yourself better. But if you want to know yourself in the twenty-first century, there are much better methods than climbing mountains, going to museums or writing diaries. Here are some practical Dataist guidelines for you: \u2018You want to know who you really are?\u2019 asks Dataism. \u2018Then forget about mountains and museums. Have you had your DNA sequenced? No?! What are you waiting for? Go and do it today. And convince your grandparents, parents and siblings to have their DNA sequenced too \u2013 their data is very valuable for you. And have you heard about these wearable biometric devices that measure your blood pressure and heart rate twenty-four hours a day? Good \u2013 so buy one of those, put it on and connect it to your smartphone. And while you are shopping, buy a mobile camera and microphone, record everything you do, and put in online. And allow Google and Facebook to read all your emails, monitor all your chats and messages, and keep a record of all your Likes and clicks. If you do all that, then the great algorithms of the Internet-of-All-Things will tell you whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war.\u2019 But where do these great algorithms come from? This is the mystery of Dataism. Just as according to Christianity we humans cannot understand God and His plan, so Dataism says the human brain cannot embrace the new master algorithms. At present, of course, the algorithms are mostly written by human hackers. Yet the really important algorithms \u2013 such as the Google search algorithm \u2013 are developed by huge teams. Each member understands just one part of the puzzle, and nobody really understands the algorithm as a whole. Moreover, with the rise of machine learning and artificial neural networks, more and more algorithms evolve independently, improving themselves and learning from their own mistakes. They analyse astronomical amounts of data, which no human can possibly encompass, and learn to recognise patterns and adopt strategies that escape the human mind. The seed algorithm may initially be developed by humans, but as it grows, it follows its own path, going where no human has gone before \u2013 and where no human can follow.\n\nA Ripple in the Data Flow\n\nDataism naturally has its critics and heretics. As we saw in Chapter 3, it\u2019s doubtful whether life can really be reduced to data flows. In particular, at present we have no idea how or why data flows could produce consciousness and subjective experiences. Maybe we\u2019ll have a good explanation in twenty years. But maybe we\u2019ll discover that organisms aren\u2019t algorithms after all. It is equally doubtful whether life boils down to decision-making. Under Dataist influence, both the life sciences and the social sciences have become obsessed with decision-making processes, as if that\u2019s all there is to life. But is it so? Sensations, emotions and thoughts certainly play an important part in making decisions, but is that their sole meaning? Dataism gains a better and better understanding of decision-making processes, but it might be adopting an increasingly skewed view of life. A critical examination of the Dataist dogma is likely to be not only the greatest scientific challenge of the twenty-first century, but also the most urgent political and economic project. Scholars in the life sciences and social sciences should ask themselves whether we miss anything when we understand life as data processing and decision-making. Is there perhaps something in the universe that cannot be reduced to data? Suppose non-conscious algorithms could eventually outperform conscious intelligence in all known data-processing tasks \u2013 what, if anything, would be lost by replacing conscious intelligence with superior non-conscious algorithms? Of course, even if Dataism is wrong and organisms aren\u2019t just algorithms, it won\u2019t necessarily prevent Dataism from taking over the world. Many previous religions gained enormous popularity and power despite their factual mistakes. If Christianity and communism could do it, why not Dataism? Dataism has especially good prospects, because it is currently spreading across all scientific disciplines. A unified scientific paradigm may easily become an unassailable dogma. It is very difficult to contest a scientific paradigm, but up till now, no single paradigm was adopted by the entire scientific establishment. Hence scholars in one field could always import heretical views from outside. But if everyone from musicologists to biologists uses the same Dataist paradigm, interdisciplinary excursions will serve only to strengthen the paradigm further. Consequently even if the paradigm is flawed, it would be extremely difficult to resist it. If Dataism succeeds in conquering the world, what will happen to us humans? In the beginning, it will probably accelerate the humanist pursuit of health, happiness and power. Dataism spreads itself by promising to fulfil these humanist aspirations. In order to gain immortality, bliss and divine powers of creation, we need to process immense amounts of data, far beyond the capacity of the human brain. So the algorithms will do it for us. Yet once authority shifts from humans to algorithms, the humanist projects may become irrelevant. Once we abandon the homo-centric world view in favour of a data-centric world view, human health and happiness may seem far less important. Why bother so much about obsolete data-processing machines when much better models are already in existence? We are striving to engineer the Internet-of-All-Things in the hope that it will make us healthy, happy and powerful. Yet once the Internet-of-All\u0002Things is up and running, we might be reduced from engineers to chips, then to data, and eventually we might dissolve within the data torrent like a clump of earth within a gushing river. Dataism thereby threatens to do to Homo sapiens what Homo sapiens has done to all other animals. In the course of history humans have created a global network, and evaluated everything according to its function within the network. For thousands of years, this boosted human pride and prejudices. Since humans fulfilled the most important functions in the network, it was easy for us to take credit for the network\u2019s achievements, and to see ourselves as the apex of creation. The lives and experiences of all other animals were undervalued, because they fulfilled far less important functions, and whenever an animal ceased to fulfil any function at all, it went extinct. However, once humans lose their functional importance to the network, we will discover that we are not the apex of creation after all. The yardsticks that we ourselves have enshrined will condemn us to join the mammoths and the Chinese river dolphins in oblivion. Looking back, humanity will turn out to be just a ripple within the cosmic data flow. We cannot really predict the future. All the scenarios outlined in this book should be understood as possibilities rather than prophecies. When we think about the future, our horizons are usually constrained by present-day ideologies and social systems. Democracy encourages us to believe in a democratic future; capitalism doesn\u2019t allow us to envisage a non-capitalist alternative; and humanism makes it difficult for us to imagine a post-human destiny. At most, we sometimes recycle past events and think about them as alternative futures. For example, twentieth\u0002century Nazism and communism serve as a blueprint for many dystopian fantasies; and science-fiction authors use medieval and ancient legacies to imagine Jedi knights and galactic emperors fighting it out with spaceships and laser guns. This book traces the origins of our present-day conditioning in order to loosen its grip and enable us to think in far more imaginative ways about our future. Instead of narrowing our horizons by forecasting a single definitive scenario, the book aims to broaden our horizons and make us aware of a much wider spectrum of options. As I have repeatedly emphasised, nobody really knows what the job market, the family or the ecology will look like in 2050, or what religions, economic systems or political structures will dominate the world. Yet broadening our horizons can backfire by making us more confused and inactive than before. With so many scenarios and possibilities, what should we pay attention to? The world is changing faster than ever before, and we are flooded by impossible amounts of data, of ideas, of promises and of threats. Humans relinquish authority to the free market, to crowd wisdom and to external algorithms partly because they cannot deal with the deluge of data. In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. People just don\u2019t know what to pay attention to, and they often spend their time investigating and debating side issues. In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore. So of everything that happens in our chaotic world, what should we focus on? If we think in term of months, we had probably focus on immediate problems such as the turmoil in the Middle East, the refugee crisis in Europe and the slowing of the Chinese economy. If we think in terms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom large.\n\nYet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are overshadowed by three interlinked processes:\n\n1\\. Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing.\n\n2\\. Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.\n\n3\\. Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.\n\nThese three processes raise three key questions, which I hope will stick in your mind long after you have finished this book:\n\n1\\. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?\n\n2\\. What\u2019s more valuable \u2013 intelligence or consciousness?\n\n3\\. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?\"",

        "\"Sapiens rule the world because only they can weave an intersubjective web of meaning: a web of laws, forces, entities and places that exist purely in their common imagination. This web allows humans alone to organise crusades, socialist revolutions and human rights movements.\nOther animals may also imagine various things. A cat waiting to ambush a mouse might not see the mouse, but may well imagine the shape and even taste of the mouse. Yet to the best of our knowledge, cats are able to imagine only things that actually exist in the world, like mice. They cannot imagine things that they have never seen or smelled or tasted \u2013 such as the US dollar, Google corporation or the European Union. Only Sapiens can imagine such chimeras.\n\nAs well as separating humans from other animals, this ability to create intersubjective entities also separates the humanities from the life sciences. Historians seek to understand the development of intersubjective entities like gods and nations, whereas biologists hardly recognise the existence of such things. Some believe that if we could only crack the genetic code and map every neuron in the brain, we will know all of humanity\u2019s secrets. After all, if humans have no soul, and if thoughts, emotions and sensations are just biochemical algorithms, why can\u2019t biology account for all the vagaries of human societies? From this perspective, the crusades were territorial disputes shaped by evolutionary pressures, and English knights going to fight Saladin in the Holy Land were not that different from wolves trying to appropriate the territory of a neighbouring pack. The humanities, in contrast, emphasise the crucial importance of intersubjective entities, which cannot be reduced to hormones and neurons. To think historically means to ascribe real power to the contents of our imaginary stories. Of course, historians don\u2019t ignore objective factors such as climate changes and genetic mutations, but they give much greater importance to the stories people invent and believe. North Korea and South Korea are so different from one another not because people in Pyongyang have different genes to people in Seoul, or because the north is colder and more mountainous. It\u2019s because the north is dominated by very different fictions.\n\nMaybe someday breakthroughs in neurobiology will enable us to explain communism and the crusades in strictly biochemical terms. Yet we are very far from that point. During the twenty-first century the border between history and biology is likely to blur not because we will discover biological explanations for historical events, but rather because ideological fictions will rewrite DNA strands; political and economic interests will redesign the climate; and the geography of mountains and rivers will give way to cyberspace. As human fictions are translated into genetic and electronic codes, the intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will merge with history. In the twenty-first century fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection. Hence if we want to understand our future, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions that give meaning to the world. \"",
        "\"The Data Religion - 1\nDataism says that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing. 1 This may strike you as some eccentric fringe notion, but in fact it has already conquered most of the scientific establishment. Dataism was born from the explosive confluence of two scientific tidal waves. In the 150 years since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, the life sciences have come to see organisms as biochemical algorithms. Simultaneously, in the eight decades since Alan Turing formulated the idea of a Turing Machine, computer scientists have learned to engineer increasingly sophisticated electronic algorithms. Dataism puts the two together, pointing out that exactly the same mathematical laws apply to both biochemical and electronic algorithms. Dataism thereby collapses the barrier between animals and machines, and expects electronic algorithms to eventually decipher and outperform biochemical algorithms. For politicians, business people and ordinary consumers, Dataism offers groundbreaking technologies and immense new powers. For scholars and intellectuals it also promises to provide the scientific holy grail that has eluded us for centuries: a single overarching theory that unifies all the scientific disciplines from literature and musicology to economics and biology. According to Dataism, King Lear and the flu virus are just two patterns of data flow that can be analysed using the same basic concepts and tools. This idea is extremely attractive. It gives all scientists a common language, builds bridges over academic rifts and easily exports insights across disciplinary borders. Musicologists, political scientists and cell biologists can finally understand each other. In the process, Dataism inverts the traditional pyramid of learning. Hitherto, data was seen as only the first step in a long chain of intellectual activity. Humans were supposed to distil data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom. However, Dataists believe that humans can no longer cope with the immense flows of data, hence they cannot distil data into information, let alone into knowledge or wisdom. The work of processing data should therefore be entrusted to electronic algorithms, whose capacity far exceeds that of the human brain. In practice, this means that Dataists are sceptical about human knowledge and wisdom, and prefer to put their trust in Big Data and computer algorithms. Dataism is most firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines: computer science and biology. Of the two, biology is the more important. It was the biological embracement of Dataism that turned a limited breakthrough in computer science into a world-shattering cataclysm that may completely transform the very nature of life. You may not agree with the idea that organisms are algorithms, and that giraffes, tomatoes and human beings are just different methods for processing data. But you should know that this is current scientific dogma, and that it is changing our world beyond recognition. Not only individual organisms are seen today as data-processing systems, but also entire societies such as beehives, bacteria colonies, forests and human cities. Economists increasingly interpret the economy, too, as a data-processing system. Laypeople believe that the economy consists of peasants growing wheat, workers manufacturing clothes, and customers buying bread and underpants. Yet experts see the economy as a mechanism for gathering data about desires and abilities, and turning this data into decisions. According to this view, free-market capitalism and state-controlled communism aren\u2019t competing ideologies, ethical creeds or political institutions. At bottom, they are competing data-processing systems. Capitalism uses distributed processing, whereas communism relies on centralised processing. Capitalism processes data by directly connecting all producers and consumers to one another, and allowing them to exchange information freely and make decisions independently. For example, how do you determine the price of bread in a free market? Well, every bakery may produce as much bread as it likes, and charge for it as much as it wants. The customers are equally free to buy as much bread as they can afford, or take their business to the competitor. It isn\u2019t illegal to charge $1,000 for a baguette, but nobody is likely to buy it. On a much grander scale, if investors predict increased demand for bread, they will buy shares of biotech firms that genetically engineer more prolific wheat strains. The inflow of capital will enable the firms to speed up their research, thereby providing more wheat faster, and averting bread shortages. Even if one biotech giant adopts a flawed theory and reaches an impasse, its more successful competitors will achieve the hoped-for breakthrough. Free-market capitalism thus distributes the work of analysing data and making decisions between many independent but interconnected processors. As the Austrian economics guru Friedrich Hayek explained, \u2018In a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people.\u2019 2 According to this view, the stock exchange is the fastest and most efficient data-processing system humankind has so far created. Everyone is welcome to join, if not directly then through their banks or pension funds. The stock exchange runs the global economy, and takes into account everything that happens all over the planet \u2013 and even beyond it. Prices are influenced by successful scientific experiments, by political scandals in Japan, by volcanic eruptions in Iceland and even by irregular activities on the surface of the sun. In order for the system to run smoothly, as much information as possible needs to flow as freely as possible. When millions of people throughout the world have access to all the relevant information, they determine the most accurate price of oil, of Hyundai shares and of Swedish government bonds by buying and selling them. It has been estimated that the stock exchange needs just fifteen minutes of trade to determine the influence of a New York Times headline on the prices of most shares. 3 Data-processing considerations also explain why capitalists favour lower taxes. Heavy taxation means that a large part of all available capital accumulates in one place \u2013 the state coffers \u2013 and consequently more and more decisions have to be made by a single processor, namely the government. This creates an overly centralised data-processing system. In extreme cases, when taxes are exceedingly high, almost all capital ends up in the government\u2019s hands, and so the government alone calls the shots. It dictates the price of bread, the location of bakeries, and the research-and-development budget. In a free market, if one processor makes a wrong decision, others will be quick to utilise its mistake. However, when a single processor makes almost all the decisions, mistakes can be catastrophic. This extreme situation in which all data is processed and all decisions are made by a single central processor is called communism. In a communist economy, people allegedly work according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs. In other words, the government takes 100 per cent of your profits, decides what you need and then supplies these needs. Though no country ever realised this scheme in its extreme form, the Soviet Union and its satellites came as close as they could. They abandoned the principle of distributed data processing, and switched to a model of centralised data processing. All information from throughout the Soviet Union flowed to a single location in Moscow, where all the important decisions were made. Producers and consumers could not communicate directly, and had to obey government orders.\n\nFor instance, the Soviet economics ministry might decide that the price of bread in all shops should be exactly two roubles and four kopeks, that a particular kolkhoz in the Odessa oblast should switch from growing wheat to raising chickens, and that the Red October bakery in Moscow should produce 3.5 million loaves of bread per day, and not a single loaf more. Meanwhile the Soviet science ministry forced all Soviet biotech laboratories to adopt the theories of Trofim Lysenko \u2013 the infamous head of the Lenin Academy for Agricultural Sciences. Lysenko rejected the dominant genetic theories of his day. He insisted that if an organism acquired some new trait during its lifetime, this quality could pass directly to its descendants. This idea flew in the face of Darwinian orthodoxy, but it dovetailed nicely with communist educational principles. It implied that if you could train wheat plants to withstand cold weather, their progenies will also be cold-resistant. Lysenko accordingly sent billions of counter-revolutionary wheat plants to be re-educated in Siberia \u2013 and the Soviet Union was soon forced to import more and more flour from the United States.\n\nCapitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological changes. The central committee of the Communist Party just could not deal with the rapidly changing world of the late twentieth century. When all data is accumulated in one secret bunker, and all important decisions are taken by a group of elderly apparatchiks, you can produce nuclear bombs by the cartload, but you won\u2019t get an Apple or a Wikipedia. There is a story (probably apocryphal, like most good stories) that when Mikhail Gorbachev tried to resuscitate the moribund Soviet economy, he sent one of his chief aids to London to find out what Thatcherism was all about, and how a capitalist system actually functioned. The hosts took their Soviet visitor on a tour of the City, of the London stock exchange and of the London School of Economics, where he had lengthy talks with bank managers, entrepreneurs and professors. After a few hours, the Soviet expert burst out: \u2018Just one moment, please. Forget about all these complicated economic theories. We have been going back and forth across London for a whole day now, and there\u2019s one thing I cannot understand. Back in Moscow, our finest minds are working on the bread supply system, and yet there are such long queues in every bakery and grocery store. Here in London live millions of people, and we have passed today in front of many shops and supermarkets, yet I haven\u2019t seen a single bread queue. Please take me to meet the person in charge of supplying bread to London. I must learn his secret.\u2019 The hosts scratched their heads, thought for a moment, and said: \u2018Nobody is in charge of supplying bread to London.\u2019 That\u2019s the capitalist secret of success. No central processing unit monopolises all the data on the London bread supply. The information flows freely between millions of consumers and producers, bakers and tycoons, farmers and scientists. Market forces determine the price of bread, the number of loaves baked each day and the research-and-development priorities. If market forces make the wrong decision, they soon correct themselves, or so capitalists believe. For our current purposes, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the theory is correct. The crucial thing is that the theory understands economics in terms of data processing.\n\nWhere Has All the Power Gone?\n\nPolitical scientists also increasingly interpret human political structures as data\u0002processing systems. Like capitalism and communism, so democracies and dictatorships are in essence competing mechanisms for gathering and analysing information. Dictatorships use centralised processing methods, whereas democracies prefer distributed processing. In the last decades democracy gained the upper hand because under the unique conditions of the late twentieth century, distributed processing worked better. Under alternative conditions \u2013 those prevailing in the ancient Roman Empire, for instance \u2013 centralised processing had an edge, which is why the Roman Republic fell and power shifted from the Senate and popular assemblies into the hands of a single autocratic emperor. This implies that as data-processing conditions change again in the twenty\u0002first century, democracy might decline and even disappear. As both the volume and speed of data increase, venerable institutions like elections, parties and parliaments might become obsolete \u2013 not because they are unethical, but because they don\u2019t process data efficiently enough. These institutions evolved in an era when politics moved faster than technology. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Industrial Revolution unfolded slowly enough for politicians and voters to remain one step ahead of it and regulate and manipulate its course. Yet whereas the rhythm of politics has not changed much since the days of steam, technology has switched from first gear to fourth. Technological revolutions now outpace political processes, causing MPs and voters alike to lose control. The rise of the Internet gives us a taste of things to come. Cyberspace is now crucial to our daily lives, our economy and our security. Yet the critical choices between alternative web designs weren\u2019t taken through a democratic political process, even though they involved traditional political issues such as sovereignty, borders, privacy and security. Did you ever vote about the shape of cyberspace? Decisions made by web designers far from the public limelight mean that today the Internet is a free and lawless zone that erodes state sovereignty, ignores borders, abolishes privacy and poses perhaps the most formidable global security risk. Whereas a decade ago it hardly registered on the radar, today hysterical officials are predicting an imminent cyber 9/11. Governments and NGOs consequently conduct intense debates about restructuring the Internet, but it is much harder to change an existing system than to intervene at its inception. Besides, by the time the cumbersome government bureaucracy makes up its mind about cyber regulation, the Internet has morphed ten times. The governmental tortoise cannot keep up with the technological hare. It is overwhelmed by data. The NSA may be spying on your every word, but to judge by the repeated failures of American foreign policy, nobody in Washington knows what to do with all the data. Never in history did a government know so much about what\u2019s going on in the world \u2013 yet few empires have botched things up as clumsily as the contemporary United States. It\u2019s like a poker player who knows what cards his opponents hold, yet somehow still manages to lose round after round. In the coming decades, it is likely that we will see more Internet-like revolutions, in which technology steals a march on politics. Artificial intelligence and biotechnology might soon overhaul our societies and economies \u2013 and our bodies and minds too \u2013 but they are hardly a blip on our political radar. Our current democratic structures just cannot collect and process the relevant data fast enough, and most voters don\u2019t understand biology and cybernetics well enough to form any pertinent opinions. Hence traditional democratic politics loses control of events, and fails to provide us with meaningful visions for the future. That doesn\u2019t mean we will go back to twentieth-century-style dictatorships. Authoritarian regimes seem to be equally overwhelmed by the pace of technological development and the speed and volume of the data flow. In the twentieth century, dictators had grand visions for the future. Communists and fascists alike sought to completely destroy the old world and build a new world in its place. Whatever you think about Lenin, Hitler or Mao, you cannot accuse them of lacking vision. Today it seems that leaders have a chance to pursue even grander visions. While communists and Nazis tried to create a new society and a new human with the help of steam engines and typewriters, today\u2019s prophets could rely on biotechnology and super-computers. In science-fiction films, ruthless Hitler-like politicians are quick to pounce on such new technologies, putting them in the service of this or that megalomaniac political ideal. Yet flesh-and-blood politicians in the early twenty-first century, even in authoritarian countries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, are nothing like their Hollywood counterparts. They don\u2019t seem to plot any Brave New World. The wildest dreams of Kim Jong-un and Ali Khamenei don\u2019t go much beyond atom bombs and ballistic missiles: that is so 1945. Putin\u2019s aspirations seem confined to rebuilding the old Soviet zone, or the even older tsarist empire. Meanwhile in the USA, paranoid Republicans accuse Barack Obama of being a ruthless despot hatching conspiracies to destroy the foundations of American society \u2013 yet in eight years of presidency he barely managed to pass a minor health-care reform. Creating new worlds and new humans is far beyond his agenda. Precisely because technology is now moving so fast, and parliaments and dictators alike are overwhelmed by data they cannot process quickly enough, present-day politicians are thinking on a far smaller scale than their predecessors a century ago. In the early twenty-first century, politics is consequently bereft of grand visions. Government has become mere administration. It manages the country, but it no longer leads it. It makes sure teachers are paid on time and sewage systems don\u2019t overflow, but it has no idea where the country will be in twenty years. To some extent, this is a very good thing. Given that some of the big political visions of the twentieth century led us to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and the Great Leap Forward, maybe we are better off in the hands of petty-minded bureaucrats. Mixing godlike technology with megalomaniac politics is a recipe for disaster. Many neo-liberal economists and political scientists argue that it is best to leave all the important decisions in the hands of the free market. They thereby give politicians the perfect excuse for inaction and ignorance, which are reinterpreted as profound wisdom. Politicians find it convenient to believe that the reason they don\u2019t understand the world is that they need not understand it. Yet mixing godlike technology with myopic politics also has its downside. Lack of vision isn\u2019t always a blessing, and not all visions are necessarily bad. In the twentieth century, the dystopian Nazi vision did not fall apart spontaneously. It was defeated by the equally grand visions of socialism and liberalism. It is dangerous to trust our future to market forces, because these forces do what\u2019s good for the market rather than what\u2019s good for humankind or for the world. The hand of the market is blind as well as invisible, and left to its own devices it may fail to do anything about the threat of global warming or the dangerous potential of artificial intelligence. Some people believe that there is somebody in charge after all. Not democratic politicians or autocratic despots, but rather a small coterie of billionaires who secretly run the world. But such conspiracy theories never work, because they underestimate the complexity of the system. A few billionaires smoking cigars and drinking Scotch in some back room cannot possibly understand everything happening on the globe, let alone control it. Ruthless billionaires and small interest groups flourish in today\u2019s chaotic world not because they read the map better than anyone else, but because they have very narrow aims. In a chaotic system, tunnel vision has its advantages, and the billionaires\u2019 power is strictly proportional to their goals. If the world\u2019s richest man would like to make another billion dollars he could easily game the system in order to achieve his goal. In contrast, if he would like to reduce global inequality or stop global warming, even he won\u2019t be able to do it, because the system is far too complex. Yet power vacuums seldom last long. If in the twenty-first century traditional political structures can no longer process the data fast enough to produce meaningful visions, then new and more efficient structures will evolve to take their place. These new structures may be very different from any previous political institutions, whether democratic or authoritarian. The only question is who will build and control these structures. If humankind is no longer up to the task, perhaps it might give somebody else a try.\"",

Harris thinks all humans share a single supreme value \u2013 minimising suffering and maximising happiness \u2013 and all ethical debates are factual arguments concerning the most efficient way to maximise happiness.\nIslamic fundamentalists want to reach heaven in order to be happy, liberals believe that increasing human liberty maximises happiness, and German nationalists think that everyone would be better off if they only allowed Berlin to run this planet. According to Harris, Islamists, liberals and nationalists have no ethical dispute; they have a factual disagreement about how best to realise their common goal. Yet even if Harris is right, and even if all humans cherish happiness, in practice it would be extremely difficult to use this insight to decide ethical disputes, particularly because we have no scientific definition or measurement of happiness.\n\nConsider the case of the Three Gorges Dam.\u00a0How many units of happiness are generated when a billion Chinese enjoy cheaper electricity?

The modern deal thus offers humans an enormous temptation, coupled with a colossal threat. Omnipotence is in front of us, almost within our reach, but below us yawns the abyss of complete nothingness.

A robo-rat is a run-of-the-mill rat with a twist: scientists have implanted electrodes into the sensory and reward areas in the rat\u2019s brain.\nThis enables the scientists to manoeuvre the rat by remote control. After short training sessions, researchers have managed not only to make the rats turn left or right, but also to climb ladders, sniff around garbage piles, and do things that rats normally dislike, such as jumping from great heights. Armies and corporations show keen interest in the robo-rats, hoping they could prove useful in many tasks and situations. For example, robo-rats could help detect survivors trapped under collapsed buildings, locate bombs and booby traps, and map underground tunnels and caves. Animal-welfare activists have voiced concern about the suffering such experiments inflict on the rats. Professor Sanjiv Talwar of the State University of New York, one of the leading robo-rat researchers, has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the rats actually enjoy the experiments. After all, explains Talwar, the rats \u2018work for pleasure\u2019 and when the electrodes stimulate the reward centre in their brain, \u2018the rat feels Nirvana\u2019. 3 To the best of our understanding, the rat doesn\u2019t feel that somebody else controls her, and she doesn\u2019t feel that she is being coerced to do something against her will. When Professor Talwar presses the remote control, the rat wants to move to the left, which is why she moves to the left. When the professor presses another switch, the rat wants to climb a ladder, which is why she climbs the ladder. After all, the rat\u2019s desires are nothing but a pattern of firing neurons. What does it matter whether the neurons are firing because they are stimulated by other neurons, or because they are stimulated by transplanted electrodes connected to Professor Talwar\u2019s remote control? If you asked the rat about it, she might well have told you, \u2018Sure I have free will! Look, I want to turn left \u2013 and I turn left. I want to climb a ladder \u2013 and I climb a ladder. Doesn\u2019t that prove that I have free will?\u2019\u00a0\n\nExperiments performed on Homo sapiens indicate that like rats humans too can be manipulated, and that it is possible to create or annihilate even complex feelings such as love, anger, fear and depression by stimulating the right spots in the human brain. The US military has recently initiated experiments on implanting computer chips in people\u2019s brains, hoping to use this method to treat soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, doctors have pioneered a novel treatment for patients suffering from acute depression. They implant electrodes into the patient\u2019s brain, and wire the electrodes to a minuscule computer implanted into the patient\u2019s breast. On receiving a command from the computer, the electrodes use weak electric currents to paralyse the brain area responsible for the depression. The treatment does not always succeed, but in some cases patients reported that the feeling of dark emptiness that tormented them throughout their lives disappeared as if by magic.\n\nOne patient complained that several months after the operation, he had a relapse, and was overcome by severe depression. Upon inspection, the doctors found the source of the problem: the computer\u2019s battery had run out of power. Once they changed the battery, the depression quickly melted away. 5 Due to obvious ethical restrictions, researchers implant electrodes into human brains only under special circumstances. Hence most relevant experiments on humans are conducted using non-intrusive helmet-like devices (technically known as \u2018transcranial direct current stimulators\u2019). The helmet is fitted with electrodes that attach to the scalp from outside. It produces weak electromagnetic fields and directs them towards specific brain areas, thereby stimulating or inhibiting select brain activities. The American military experiments with such helmets in the hope of sharpening the focus and enhancing the performance of soldiers both in training sessions and on the battlefield. The main experiments are conducted in the Human Effectiveness Directorate, which is located in an Ohio air force base. Though the results are far from conclusive, and though the hype around transcranial stimulators currently runs far ahead of actual achievements, several studies have indicated that the method may indeed enhance the cognitive abilities of drone operators, air-traffic controllers, snipers and other personnel whose duties require them to remain highly attentive for extended periods.\n\nSally Adee, a journalist for the New Scientist, was allowed to visit a training facility for snipers and test the effects herself. At first, she entered a battlefield simulator without wearing the transcranial helmet. Sally describes how fear swept over her as she saw twenty masked men, strapped with suicide bombs and armed with rifles, charge straight towards her. \u2018For every one I manage to shoot dead,\u2019 writes Sally, \u2018three new assailants pop up from nowhere. I\u2019m clearly not shooting fast enough, and panic and incompetence are making me continually jam my rifle.\u2019 Luckily for her, the assailants were just video images, projected on huge screens all around her. Still, she was so disappointed with her poor performance that she felt like putting down the rifle and leaving the simulator. Then they wired her up to the helmet. She reports feeling nothing unusual, except a slight tingle and a strange metallic taste in her mouth. Yet she began picking off the terrorists one by one, as coolly and methodically as if she were Rambo or Clint Eastwood. \u2018As twenty of them run at me brandishing their guns, I calmly line up my rifle, take a moment to breathe deeply, and pick off the closest one, before tranquilly assessing my next target. In what seems like next to no time, I hear a voice call out, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it.\u201d The lights come up in the simulation room . . . In the sudden quiet amid the bodies around me, I was really expecting more assailants, and I\u2019m a bit disappointed when the team begins to remove my electrodes. I look up and wonder if someone wound the clocks forward. Inexplicably, twenty minutes have just passed. \u201cHow many did I get?\u201d I ask the assistant.

Achieving real happiness is not going to be much easier than overcoming old age and death. The glass ceiling of happiness is held in place by two stout pillars, one psychological, the other biological. On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. We don\u2019t become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon. Dramatic improvements in conditions, as humankind has experienced in recent decades, translate into greater expectations rather than greater contentment. If we don\u2019t do something about this, our future achievements too might leave us as dissatisfied as ever. On the biological level, both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our biochemistry, rather than by our economic, social or political situation.

Jeremy Bentham similarly maintained that nature gave dominion over man to two masters \u2013 pleasure and pain \u2013 and they alone determine everything we do, say and think.

        "\"The Meaning of Life\nThe narrating self is the star of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s story \u2018A Problem\u2019. 19 The story deals with Don Quixote, the eponymous hero of Miguel Cervantes\u2019s famous novel. Don Quixote creates for himself an imaginary world in which he is a legendary champion going forth to fight giants and save Lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In reality, Don Quixote is Alonso Quixano, an elderly country gentleman; the noble Dulcinea is an uncouth farm girl from a nearby village; and the giants are windmills. What would happen, wonders Borges, if out of his belief in these fantasies, Don Quixote attacks and kills a real person? Borges asks a fundamental question about the human condition: what happens when the yarns spun by our narrating self cause great harm to ourselves or those around us? There are three main possibilities, says Borges.\n\nOne option is that nothing much happens. Don Quixote will not be bothered at all by killing a real man. His delusions are so overpowering that he could not tell the difference between this incident and his imaginary duel with the windmill giants.\n\nAnother option is that once he takes a real life, Don Quixote will be so horrified that he will be shaken out of his delusions. This is akin to a young recruit who goes to war believing that it is good to die for one\u2019s country, only to be completely disillusioned by the realities of warfare.\n\nAnd there is a third option, much more complex and profound. As long as he fought imaginary giants, Don Quixote was just play-acting, but once he actually kills somebody, he will cling to his fantasies for all he is worth, because they are the only thing giving meaning to his terrible crime. Paradoxically, the more sacrifices we make for an imaginary story, the stronger the story becomes, because we desperately want to give meaning to these sacrifices and to the suffering we have caused.\n\nIn politics this is known as the \u2018Our Boys Didn\u2019t Die in Vain\u2019 syndrome.

Italian politicians gave fiery speeches in parliament, vowing historical redress and promising a return to the glories of ancient Rome. Hundreds of thousands of Italian recruits went to the front shouting, \u2018For Trento and Trieste!\u2019 They thought it would be a walkover. It was anything but. The Austro-Hungarian army held a strong defensive line along the Isonzo River. The Italians hurled themselves against the line in eleven gory battles, gaining a few kilometres at most, and never securing a breakthrough. In the first battle they lost 15,000 men. In the second battle they lost 40,000 men. In the third battle they lost 60,000. So it continued for more than two dreadful years until the eleventh engagement, when the Austrians finally counter-attacked, and in the Battle of Caporreto soundly defeated the Italians and pushed them back almost to the gates of Venice. The glorious adventure became a bloodbath. By the end of the war, almost 700,000 Italian soldiers were killed, and more than a million were wounded. After losing the first Isonzo battle, Italian politicians had two choices. They could admit their mistake and sign a peace treaty. Austria\u2013Hungary had no claims against Italy, and would have been delighted to sign a peace treaty because it was busy fighting for survival against the much stronger Russians. Yet how could the politicians go to the parents, wives and children of 15,000 dead Italian soldiers, and tell them: \u2018Sorry, there has been a mistake. We hope you don\u2019t take it too hard, but your Giovanni died in vain, and so did your Marco.\u2019 Alternatively they could say: \u2018Giovanni and Marco were heroes! They died so that Trieste would be Italian, and we will make sure they didn\u2019t die in vain. We will go on fighting until victory is ours!\u2019 Not surprisingly, the politicians preferred the second option. So they fought a second battle, and lost another 40,000 men. The politicians again decided it would be best to keep on fighting, because \u2018our boys didn\u2019t die in vain\u2019\n\nYet you cannot blame only the politicians. The masses also kept supporting the war. And when after the war Italy did not get all the territories it demanded, Italian democracy placed at its head Benito Mussolini and his fascists, who promised they would gain for Italy a proper compensation for all the sacrifices it had made. While it\u2019s hard for a politician to tell parents that their son died for no good reason, it is far more difficult for parents to say this to themselves \u2013 and it is even harder for the victims. A crippled soldier who lost his legs would rather tell himself, \u2018I sacrificed myself for the glory of the eternal Italian nation!\u2019 than \u2018I lost my legs because I was stupid enough to believe self-serving politicians.\u2019 It is much easier to live with the fantasy, because the fantasy gives meaning to the suffering.\n\nPriests discovered this principle thousands of years ago. It underlies numerous religious ceremonies and commandments. If you want to make people believe in imaginary entities such as gods and nations, you should make them sacrifice something valuable. The more painful the sacrifice, the more convinced people are of the existence of the imaginary recipient. A poor peasant sacrificing a priceless bull to Jupiter will become convinced that Jupiter really exists, otherwise how can he excuse his stupidity? The peasant will sacrifice another bull, and another, and another, just so he won\u2019t have to admit that all the previous bulls were wasted. For exactly the same reason, if I have sacrificed a child to the glory of the Italian nation, or my legs to the communist revolution, it\u2019s enough to turn me into a zealous Italian nationalist or an enthusiastic communist. For if Italian national myths or communist propaganda are a lie, then I will be forced to admit that my child\u2019s death or my own paralysis have been completely pointless. Few people have the stomach to admit such a thing.\n\nNot only governments fall into this trap. Business corporations often sink millions into failed enterprises, while private individuals cling to dysfunctional marriages and dead-end jobs. For the narrating self would much prefer to go on suffering in the future, just so it won\u2019t have to admit that our past suffering was devoid of all meaning. Eventually, if we want to come clean about past mistakes, our narrating self must invent some twist in the plot that will infuse these mistakes with meaning. For example, a pacifist war veteran may tell himself, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve lost my legs because of a mistake. But thanks to this mistake, I understand that war is hell, and from now onwards I will dedicate my life to fight for peace. So my injury did have some positive meaning: it taught me to value peace.' \"",

        "\"The last nail in freedom\u2019s coffin is provided by the theory of evolution. Just as evolution cannot be squared with eternal souls, neither can it swallow the idea of free will. For if humans are free, how could natural selection have shaped them? According to the theory of evolution, all the choices animals make \u2013 whether of residence, food or mates \u2013 reflect their genetic code.\nIf, thanks to its fit genes, an animal chooses to eat a nutritious mushroom and copulate with healthy and fertile mates, these genes pass on to the next generation. If, because of unfit genes, an animal chooses poisonous mushrooms and anaemic mates, these genes become extinct. However, if an animal \u2018freely\u2019 chooses what to eat and with whom to mate, then natural selection is left with nothing to work on. When confronted with such scientific explanations, people often brush them aside, pointing out that they feel free, and that they act according to their own wishes and decisions. This is true. Humans act according to their desires. If by \u2018free will\u2019 you mean the ability to act according to your desires \u2013 then yes, humans have free will, and so do chimpanzees, dogs and parrots. When Polly wants a cracker, Polly eats a cracker. But the million-dollar question is not whether parrots and humans can act out their inner desires \u2013 the question is whether they can choose their desires in the first place.Why does Polly want a cracker rather than a cucumber? Why do I decide to kill my annoying neighbour instead of turning the other cheek? Why do I want to buy the red car rather than the black? Why do I prefer voting for the Conservatives rather than the Labour Party? I don\u2019t choose any of these wishes. I feel a particular wish welling up within me because this is the feeling created by the biochemical processes in my brain. These processes might be deterministic or random, but not free.\n\nThese are not just hypotheses or philosophical speculations. Today we can use brain scanners to predict people\u2019s desires and decisions well before they are aware of them. In one kind of experiment, people are placed within a huge brain scanner, holding a switch in each hand. They are asked to press one of the two switches whenever they feel like it. Scientists observing neural activity in the brain can predict which switch the person will press well before the person actually does so, and even before the person is aware of their own intention. Neural events in the brain indicating the person\u2019s decision begin from a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds before the person is aware of this choice.\"",
        "\"A Catholic soldier fighting at the Battle of White Mountain could say to himself: \u2018True, I am suffering. But the Pope and the emperor say that we are fighting for a good cause, so my suffering is meaningful.\u2019 Otto Dix employed an opposite kind of logic. He saw personal experience as the source of all meaning, hence his line of thinking said: \u2018I am suffering \u2013 and this is bad \u2013 hence the whole war is bad. And if the kaiser and the clergy nevertheless support the war, they must be mistaken.\u2019\"",
        "\"We are on the brink of a momentous revolution. Humans are in danger of losing their value, because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.\nUntil today, high intelligence always went hand in hand with a developed consciousness. Only conscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence, such as playing chess, driving cars, diagnosing diseases or identifying terrorists. However, we are now developing new types of non-conscious intelligence that can perform such tasks far better than humans. For all these tasks are based on pattern recognition, and non-conscious algorithms may soon excel human consciousness in recognising patterns. This raises a novel question: which of the two is really important, intelligence or consciousness? As long as they went hand in hand, debating their relative value was just a pastime for philosophers. But in the twenty-first century, this is becoming an urgent political and economic issue. And it is sobering to realise that, at least for armies and corporations, the answer is straightforward: intelligence is mandatory but consciousness is optional.\n\nArmies and corporations cannot function without intelligent agents, but they don\u2019t need consciousness and subjective experiences. The conscious experiences of a flesh-and-blood taxi driver are infinitely richer than those of a self-driving car, which feels absolutely nothing. The taxi driver can enjoy music while navigating the busy streets of Seoul. His mind may expand in awe as he looks up at the stars and contemplates the mysteries of the universe. His eyes may fill with tears of joy when he sees his baby girl taking her very first step. But the system doesn\u2019t need all that from a taxi driver. All it really wants is to bring passengers from point A to point B as quickly, safely and cheaply as possible. And the autonomous car will soon be able to do that far better than a human driver, even though it cannot enjoy music or be awestruck by the magic of existence. Indeed, if we forbid humans to drive taxis and cars altogether, and give computer algorithms monopoly over traffic, we can then connect all vehicles to a single network, and thereby make car accidents virtually impossible. \"",

        "\"When a neuron fires an electric charge, this may either be a deterministic reaction to external stimuli, or it might be the outcome of a random event such as the spontaneous decomposition of a radioactive atom. Neither option leaves any room for free will. Decisions reached through a chain reaction of biochemical events, each determined by a previous event, are certainly not free. Decisions resulting from random subatomic accidents aren\u2019t free either. They are just random.

    "Way of the Wolf": [
        "\"Powerful tips and guidelines for creating language patterns for the body and the close.\n1 The moment you finish the transition, your first words in the main body should be the exact name of your product, process, program, or service you\u2019re offering. Here\u2019s an example of this that I wrote for the\n\nmovie The Wolf of Wall Street:\n\n\u201cName of the company . . . Aerotyne International. It\u2019s a cutting- edge, high-tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a next generation of radar detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications.\u201d\n\n2 The next language pattern should be no more than one or two paragraphs and be focused on a benefit that directly fills the clients need. (Only mention that feature.) If possible, try to use comparisons and metaphors to illustrate your point, as they are far more effective than facts and figures alone. In addition, if you can ethically link the above pattern to a trustworthy person or institution, like a Warren Buffett or J. P. Morgan,then do it. (Also, check to see if your company knows of any high-profile people who have used your product and liked it.) The bottom line is that anytime you can leverage the credibility of a respected person or institution, you should try to bring it into your presentation.\n\n3 After you\u2019re done with the pattern, you should say, \u201cYou follow me so far?\u201d or \u201cMake sense?\u201d You can only move forward after the prospect says yes; otherwise you\u2019ll break rapport and enter the death zone. But once they agree with you\u2014boom!\u2014you\u2019ve completed one full language pattern.\n\n4 Now, repeat steps two and three one more time\u2014and then one more time again, but no more than that, or you\u2019ll run the risk of overwhelming the client. Always remember, you\u2019re framing, not front-loading!\n\n5 As you\u2019re transitioning into your close, you should try to create some type of urgency\u2014meaning, why the customer needs to buy now. If you\u2019re in an industry where there\u2019s not a lot of inherent urgency, then try to at least use tonal scarcity to imply urgency. But don\u2019t create false urgency; that\u2019s not okay.\n\n6 Moving from the main body to the close, we start with a transitional pattern that explains how simple it is to get the buying process started. (This is your energy in, benefits out equation.)\n\n7 Then you directly ask for the order, with no beating around the bush. The reason I\u2019m highlighting this is that after spending the last ten years training sales forces all around the world, I\u2019ve found that the vast majority of salespeople don\u2019t ask for the order very much. Either they dance around it, or they leave it open-ended, as if they\u2019re hoping the prospect will just come right out and say they want to buy it. In point of fact, most studies peg the optimum number of times that a salesperson should ask for the order as somewhere between five and seven times. Personally, however, I strongly disagree, and I think that number has more to do with poorly trained salespeople going through the closing process in a wildly inefficient way. Three or four times should be more than enough when you\u2019re using the Straight Line System. Remember, this is not about pressuring people into making bad decisions; this is about using the Straight Line System to create massive certainty in the mind of your prospect, on both a logical and emotional level, and then asking for the order in a low-pressure, graceful way. Here\u2019s a typical language pattern for a close:\n\nGive me one shot, and believe me, if I\u2019m even half-right, the only problem you\u2019ll have is that I didn\u2019t call you six months ago and get you started then.

        "\"Respected US financial research firm Dalbar has been tracking investors\u2019 real returns for decades.\nAnd here\u2019s the shocker: their research shows that the average investor earned 3.7 per cent annually over the past 30 years, during a period in which a basic index fund returned 11.1 per cent annually. In other words, the average investor underperformed the market by approximately 7.4 per cent each year for three decades. Here\u2019s another way to explain it:\n\nLet\u2019s say you invested $100 000 in a no-brainer index fund (that automatically buys all the companies that make up a sharemarket index, and tracks the market), and then headed off to the Thai island of Ko Pha Ngan and did nothing but drink buckets of whisky on the beach for the next 30 years. When you return, your $100 000 investment would be worth $2 351 916.\n\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019d diligently read the Wall Street Journal each morning \u2014 hired a financial advisor to pick the latest hot share funds; spent your nights stressing about the 1987 crash, the Asian Financial Crisis and the Global Financial Crisis; and basically behaved like everyone else \u2014 30 years later you\u2019d have \u2026 $297 415.

        "\" \u2018Doubles every seven to 10 years\u2019 line is rubbish when it comes to property.\nProfessor Nigel Stapledon from UNSW, who researched long-term Aussie property prices for his PhD. The professor found that the average price of a Melbourne property from 1901 to 2015 increased by an average 2.1 per cent per year, after factoring in inflation. But wait, there\u2019s more: that 2.1 per cent doesn\u2019t include the money spent on paying interest to the bank, or maintenance spent on the home.\n\nProfessor Robert Shiller, of Yale University, looked at long-term US property prices from 1890 to 2004 and found that inflation-adjusted house prices increased by a miniscule 0.4 per cent annually.\n\nAnd just to round out the Western world, Professor Piet Eichholtz of Maastricht University looked at property prices in Europe, specifically on one of Amsterdam\u2019s most significant canals, Herengracht. He was able to track the buys and sells of a single property for a full 345 years. The result? A return of 0.2 per cent per annum after inflation. Real home prices did roughly double, but they took nearly 350 years to do so, says Shiller.\n\nNow it\u2019s true that, in some areas in Australia, property has doubled every seven to 10 years over the past 24 years \u2014 but not when you factor in inflation, interest costs, upkeep and maintenance. What\u2019s more, these figures only show the sale price, not the money spent building or renovating. Say I buy a house for $500 000, demolish it and spend $1 million building a new home. I later sell it for $1.5 million. How much have I made? Zero. Yet the house price data reports that the price has gone up 200 per cent.\n\nWhen you look at the past 24 years from a historical view, this period has been an outlier \u2014 a once-in-a-lifetime boom \u2014 brought on by some unique factors: mortgage interest rates falling from a peak of 18 per cent in the late 80s to around 4 per cent today household debt ballooning to 175 per cent of household income, the highest in the world tax breaks for negatively geared properties, which have encouraged Baby Boomers to borrow on the equity in their homes to buy loss-making investments.

The quartet published an internal, classified paper for the IDA called \u201cProbabilistic Models for and Prediction of Stock Market Behavior\u201d that proposed a method of trading that the researchers claimed could generate annual gains of at least 50 percent.\nSimons and his colleagues ignored the basic information most investors focus on, such as earnings, dividends, and corporate news, what the code breakers termed the \u201cfundamental economic statistics of the market.\u201d Instead, they proposed searching for a small number of \u201cmacroscopic variables\u201d capable of predicting the market\u2019s short-term behavior. They posited that the market had as many as eight underlying \u201cstates\u201d\u2014such as \u201chigh variance,\u201d when stocks experienced larger-than-average moves, and \u201cgood,\u201d when shares generally rose. Here\u2019s what was really unique: The paper didn\u2019t try to identify or predict these states using economic theory or other conventional methods, nor did the researchers seek to address why the market entered certain states. Simons and his colleagues used mathematics to determine the set of states best fitting the observed pricing data; their model then made its bets accordingly. The whys didn\u2019t matter, Simons and his colleagues seemed to suggest, just the strategies to take advantage of the inferred states. For the majority of investors, this was an unheard-of approach, but gamblers would have understood it well. Poker players surmise the mood of their opponents by judging their behavior and adjusting their strategies accordingly. Facing off against someone in a miserable mood calls for certain tactics; others are optimal if a competitor seems overjoyed and overconfident. Players don\u2019t need to know why their opponent is glum or exuberant to profit from those moods; they just have to identify the moods themselves. Simons and the code-breakers proposed a similar approach to predicting stock prices, relying on a sophisticated mathematical tool called a hidden Markov model. Just as a gambler might guess an opponent\u2019s mood based on his or her decisions, an investor might deduce a market\u2019s state from its price movements\"",

When Simons and Baum developed their hypothetical trading model at the IDA, a decade prior, they, too, had described the market as a Markov-like process. To improve their predictive models, Ax concluded it was time to bring in someone with experience developing stochastic equations, the broader family of equations to which Markov chains belong. Stochastic equations model dynamic processes that evolve over time and can involve a high level of uncertainty. Straus had recently read academic literature suggesting that trading models based on stochastic equations could be valuable tools.\n\nThese equations can make predictions using data that appears random; weather-forecasting models, for example, use stochastic equations to generate reasonably accurate estimates. Members of Axcom\u2019s team viewed investing through a math prism and understood financial markets to be complicated and evolving, with behavior that is difficult to predict, at least over long stretches\u2014just like a stochastic process. It\u2019s easy to see why they saw similarities between stochastic processes and investing. For one thing, Simons, Ax, and Straus didn\u2019t believe the market was truly a \u201crandom walk,\u201d or entirely unpredictable, as some academics and others argued. Though it clearly had elements of randomness, much like the weather, mathematicians like Simons and Ax would argue that a probability distribution could capture futures prices as well as any other stochastic process.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to invent a mathematical model and use it as a framework to infer some consequences and conclusions,\u201d Carmona says. \u201cThe name of the game is not to always be right, but to be right often enough.\u201d \"",

In truth, there likely are fewer inefficiencies and opportunities for investors than generally presumed.

Scientists themselves are not always aware of the political, economic and religious interests that control the flow of money; many scientists do, in fact, act out of pure intellectual curiosity. However, only rarely do scientists dictate the scientific agenda.\n\nEven if we wanted to finance pure science unaffected by political, economic or religious interests, it would probably be impossible. Our resources are limited, after all. Ask a congressman to allocate an additional million dollars to the National Science Foundation for basic research, and he\u2019ll justifiably ask whether that money wouldn\u2019t be better used to fund teacher training or to give a needed tax break to a troubled factory in his district. To channel limited resources we must answer questions such as \u2018What is more important?\u2019 and \u2018What is good?\u2019 And these are not scientific questions. Science can explain what exists in the world, how things work, and what might be in the future. By definition, it has no pretensions to knowing what should be in the future. Only religions and ideologies seek to answer such questions. Consider the following quandary: two biologists from the same department, possessing the same professional skills, have both applied for a million-dollar grant to finance their current research projects. Professor Slughorn wants to study a disease that infects the udders of cows, causing a 10 per cent decrease in their milk production. Professor Sprout wants to study whether cows suffer mentally when they are separated from their calves. Assuming that the amount of money is limited, and that it is impossible to finance both research projects, which one should be funded? There is no scientific answer to this question. There are only political, economic and religious answers. In today\u2019s world, it is obvious that Slughorn has a better chance of getting the money. Not because udder diseases are scientifically more interesting than bovine mentality, but because the dairy industry, which stands to benefit from the research, has more political and economic clout than the animal-rights lobby. Perhaps in a strict Hindu society, where cows are sacred, or in a society committed to animal rights, Professor Sprout would have a better shot. But as long as she lives in a society that values the commercial potential of milk and the health of its human citizens over the feelings of cows, she\u2019d best write up her research proposal so as to appeal to those assumptions. For example, she might write that \u2018Depression leads to a decrease in milk production. If we understand the mental world of dairy cows, we could develop psychiatric medication that will improve their mood, thus raising milk production by up to 10 per cent. I estimate that there is a global annual market of $250 million for bovine psychiatric medications.\u2019\n\nScience is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining what to do with its discoveries. For example, from a purely scientific viewpoint it is unclear what we should do with our increasing understanding of genetics. Should we use this knowledge to cure cancer, to create a race of genetically engineered supermen, or to engineer dairy cows with super-sized udders? It is obvious that a liberal government, a Communist government, a Nazi government and a capitalist business corporation would use the very same scientific discovery for completely different purposes, and there is no scientific reason to prefer one usage over others. In short, scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justifies the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology influences the scientific agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries. Hence in order to comprehend how humankind has reached Alamogordo and the moon \u2013 rather than any number of alternative destinations \u2013 it is not enough to survey the achievements of physicists, biologists and sociologists. We have to take into account the ideological, political and economic forces that shaped physics, biology and sociology, pushing them in certain directions while neglecting others.\"",

Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don\u2019t know each other and don\u2019t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.\n\nMoney has a darker side. For although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour \u2013 we trust the coin they hold. If they run out of coins, we run out of trust.

        "\"Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values.\nYet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality. The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.\n\nContemporary American politics also revolve around this contradiction. Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means raising taxes to fund programmes to help the poor, elderly and infirm. But that infringes on the freedom of individuals to spend their money as they wish. Why should the government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put my kids through college? Republicans, on the other hand, want to maximise individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health care. Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture\u2019s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species.

        "\"A person who just won the lottery or found new love and jumps from joy is not really reacting to the money or the lover.\nShe is reacting to various hormones coursing through her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals flashing between different parts of her brain. Unfortunately for all hopes of creating heaven on earth, our internal biochemical system seems to be programmed to keep happiness levels relatively constant. There\u2019s no natural selection for happiness as such \u2013 a happy hermit\u2019s genetic line will go extinct as the genes of a pair of anxious parents get carried on to the next generation. Happiness and misery play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising, then, that evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too happy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant sensations.\n\nFor example, evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males who spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to look for additional fertile females. Some scholars compare human biochemistry to an air-conditioning system that keeps the temperature constant, come heatwave or snowstorm. Events might momentarily change the temperature, but the air-conditioning system always returns the temperature to the same set point.\n\nSome air-conditioning systems are set at twenty-five degrees Celsius. Others are set at twenty degrees. Human happiness conditioning systems also differ from person to person. On a scale from one to ten, some people are born with a cheerful biochemical system that allows their mood to swing between levels six and ten, stabilising with time at eight. Such a person is quite happy even if she lives in an alienating big city, loses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is diagnosed with diabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that swings between three and seven and stabilises at five. Such an unhappy person remains depressed even if she enjoys the support of a tight-knit community, wins millions in the lottery and is as healthy as an Olympic athlete. Indeed, even if our gloomy friend wins $50,000,000 in the morning, discovers the cure for both AIDS and cancer by noon, makes peace between Israelis and Palestinians that afternoon, and then in the evening reunites with her long-lost child who disappeared years ago \u2013 she would still be incapable of experiencing anything beyond level seven happiness. Her brain is simply not built for exhilaration, come what may. Think for a moment of your family and friends. You know some people who remain relatively joyful, no matter what befalls them. And then there are those who are always disgruntled, no matter what gifts the world lays at their feet. We tend to believe that if we could just change our workplace, get married, finish writing that novel, buy a new car or repay the mortgage, we would be on top of the world. Yet when we get what we desire we don\u2019t seem to be any happier. Buying cars and writing novels do not change our biochemistry.

As long as nobody punctured their fantasies, why shouldn\u2019t they?\nAs far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. The other-worldly meanings medieval people found in their lives were no more deluded than the modern humanist, nationalist and capitalist meanings modern people find. The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. So perhaps happiness is synchronising one\u2019s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction.

The Roman Empire did not require the Christians to give up their beliefs and rituals, but it did expect them to pay respect to the empire\u2019s protector gods and to the divinity of the emperor. This was seen as a declaration of political loyalty. When the Christians vehemently refused to do so, and went on to reject all attempts at compromise, the Romans reacted by persecuting what they understood to be a politically subversive faction. And even this was done half-heartedly. In the 300 years from the crucifixion of Christ to the conversion of Emperor Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no more than four general persecutions of Christians. Local administrators and governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.1 In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion.\n\nThe religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved accepted Christ\u2019s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God\u2019s greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven depends upon his or her own good deeds magnifies his own importance, and implies that Christ\u2019s suffering on the cross and God\u2019s love for humankind are not enough.\n\nThese theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds of thousands. On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God\u2019s love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew\u2019s Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours. When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican\u2019s rooms with a fresco of the massacre (the room is currently off-limits to visitors).2 More Christians were killed by fellow Christians in those twenty-four hours than by the polytheistic Roman Empire throughout its entire existence.\"",

        "\" A person who does not crave cannot suffer.\nSuffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.\n\nThe central figure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha Gautama. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was heir to a small Himalayan kingdom, sometime around 500 BC. The young prince was deeply affected by the suffering evident all around him. He saw that men and women, children and old people, all suffer not just from occasional calamities such as war and plague, but also from anxiety, frustration and discontent, all of which seem to be an inseparable part of the human condition. People pursue wealth and power, acquire knowledge and possessions, beget sons and daughters, and build houses and palaces. Yet no matter what they achieve, they are never content. Those who live in poverty dream of riches. Those who have a million want two million. Those who have two million want 10 million. Even the rich and famous are rarely satisfied. They too are haunted by ceaseless cares and worries, until sickness, old age and death put a bitter end to them. Everything that one has accumulated vanishes like smoke. Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it? At the age of twenty-nine Gautama slipped away from his palace in the middle of the night, leaving behind his family and possessions. He travelled as a homeless vagabond throughout northern India, searching for a way out of suffering. He visited ashrams and sat at the feet of gurus but nothing liberated him entirely \u2013 some dissatisfaction always remained. He did not despair. He resolved to investigate suffering on his own until he found a method for complete liberation. He spent six years meditating on the essence, causes and cures for human anguish. In the end he came to the realisation that suffering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one\u2019s own mind. Gautama\u2019s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatisfied and restless. This is very clear when we experience unpleasant things, such as pain. As long as the pain continues, we are dissatisfied and do all we can to avoid it. Yet even when we experience pleasant things we are never content. We either fear that the pleasure might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify. People dream for years about finding love but are rarely satisfied when they find it. Some become anxious that their partner will leave; others feel that they have settled cheaply, and could have found someone better.\n\nGreat gods can send us rain, social institutions can provide justice and good health care, and lucky coincidences can turn us into millionaires, but none of them can change our basic mental patterns. Hence even the greatest kings are doomed to live in angst, constantly fleeing grief and anguish, forever chasing after greater pleasures. Gautama found that there was a way to exit this vicious circle. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind. But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question, \u2018What am I experiencing now?\u2019 rather than on \u2018What would I rather be experiencing?\u2019 It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible. Gautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical rules meant to make it easier for people to focus on actual experience and to avoid falling into cravings and fantasies. He instructed his followers to avoid killing, promiscuous sex and theft, since such acts necessarily stoke the fire of craving (for power, for sensual pleasure, or for wealth). When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as nirvana (the literal meaning of which is \u2018extinguishing the fire\u2019). Those who have attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suffering. They experience reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions. While they will most likely still encounter unpleasantness and pain, such experiences cause them no misery. A person who does not crave cannot suffer.\"",

It is true that married people are happier than singles and divorcees, but that does not necessarily mean that marriage produces happiness. It could be that happiness causes marriage. Or more correctly, that serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin bring about and maintain a marriage. People who are born with a cheerful biochemistry are generally happy and content. Such people are more attractive spouses, and consequently they have a greater chance of getting married. They are also less likely to divorce, because it is far easier to live with a happy and content spouse than with a depressed and dissatisfied one.

        "\"Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists.\nA religion that recognises the legitimacy of other faiths implies either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it received from God just part of the universal truth. Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all competition.\n\nYet just as animism continued to survive within polytheism, so polytheism continued to survive within monotheism. In theory, once a person believes that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, what\u2019s the point in worshipping partial powers? Who would want to approach a lowly bureaucrat when the president\u2019s office is open to you? Indeed, monotheist theology tends to deny the existence of all gods except the supreme God, and to pour hellfire and brimstone over anyone who dares worship them.\n\nYet there has always been a chasm between theological theories and historical realities. Most people have found it difficult to digest the monotheist idea fully. They have continued to divide the world into \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018they\u2019, and to see the supreme power of the universe as too distant and alien for their mundane needs. The monotheist religions expelled the gods through the front door with a lot of fanfare, only to take them back in through the side window. Christianity, for example, developed its own pantheon of saints, whose cults differed little from those of the polytheistic gods.\n\nJust as the god Jupiter defended Rome and Huitzilopochtli protected the Aztec Empire, so every Christian kingdom had its own patron saint who helped it overcome difficulties and win wars. England was protected by St George, Scotland by St Andrew, Hungary by St Stephen, and France had St Martin. Cities and towns, professions, and even diseases \u2013 each had their own saint. The city of Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian protected chimney cleaners, whereas St Mathew lent a hand to tax collectors in distress. If you suffered from headaches you had to pray to St Agathius, but if from toothaches, then St Apollonia was a much better audience.\n\nThe Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.\"",

        "\"Dualism is a very attractive world view because it has a short and simple answer to the famous Problem of Evil, one of the fundamental concerns of human thought.\n'Why is there evil in the world? Why is there suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people?\u2019 Monotheists have to practise intellectual gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the world. One well-known explanation is that this is God\u2019s way of allowing for human free will. Were there no evil, humans could not choose between good and evil, and hence there would be no free will. This, however, is a non-intuitive answer that immediately raises a host of new questions. Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed choose evil and, according to the standard monotheist account, this choice must bring divine punishment in its wake. If God knew in advance that a particular person would use her free will to choose evil, and that as a result she would be punished for this by eternal tortures in hell, why did God create her? Theologians have written countless books to answer such questions. Some find the answers convincing. Some don\u2019t. What\u2019s undeniable is that monotheists have a hard time dealing with the Problem of Evil.\n\nFor dualists, it\u2019s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people because the world is not governed single-handedly by a good God. There is an independent evil power loose in the world. The evil power does bad things.\n\nDualism has its own drawbacks. While solving the Problem of Evil, it is unnerved by the Problem of Order. If the world was created by a single God, it\u2019s clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing this cosmic war? Two rival states can fight one another because both obey the same laws of physics. A missile launched from Pakistan can hit targets in India because gravity works the same way in both countries. When Good and Evil fight, what common laws do they obey, and who decreed these laws?\n\nSo, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe \u2013 and He\u2019s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.\n\nJewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous dualist beliefs and practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what we call \u2018monotheism\u2019 are, in fact, dualist in origin and spirit. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in a powerful evil force \u2013 like the one Christians call the Devil or Satan \u2013 who can act independently, fight against the good God, and wreak havoc without God\u2019s permission. How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is impossible. Either you believe in a single omnipotent God or you believe in two opposing powers, neither of which is omnipotent. Still, humans have a wonderful capacity to believe in contradictions. So it should not come as a surprise that millions of pious Christians, Muslims and Jews manage to believe at one and the same time in an omnipotent God and an independent Devil. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews have gone so far as to imagine that the good God even needs our help in its struggle against the Devil, which inspired among other things the call for jihads and crusades.\n\nMonotheists could not help but be captivated by dualist dichotomies, precisely because they helped them address the problem of evil. So such oppositions eventually became cornerstones of Christian and Muslim thought. Belief in heaven (the realm of the good god) and hell (the realm of the evil god) was also dualist in origin. There is no trace of this belief in the Old Testament, which also never claims that the souls of people continue to live after the death of the body.\n\nIn fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from different sources. It\u2019s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.\"",

        "\"A small, insignificant mountain town called Numantia, inhabited by the peninsula\u2019s native Celts, had dared to throw off the Roman yoke.\nRome at the time was the unquestioned master of the entire Mediterranean basin, having vanquished the Macedonian and Seleucid empires, subjugated the proud city states of Greece, and turned Carthage into a smouldering ruin. The Numantians had nothing on their side but their fierce love of freedom and their inhospitable terrain. Yet they forced legion after legion to surrender or retreat in shame.\n\nEventually, in 134 BC, Roman patience snapped. The Senate decided to send Scipio Aemilianus, Rome\u2019s foremost general and the man who had levelled Carthage, to take care of the Numantians. He was given a massive army of more than 30,000 soldiers. Scipio, who respected the fighting spirit and martial skill of the Numantians, preferred not to waste his soldiers in unnecessary combat. Instead, he encircled Numantia with a line of fortifications, blocking the town\u2019s contact with the outside world. Hunger did his work for him. After more than a year, the food supply ran out. When the Numantians realised that all hope was lost, they burned down their town; according to Roman accounts, most of them killed themselves so as not to become Roman slaves.\n\nNumantia later became a symbol of Spanish independence and courage. Miguel de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote, wrote a tragedy called The Siege of Numantia which ends with the town\u2019s destruction, but also with a vision of Spain\u2019s future greatness. Poets composed paeans to its fierce defenders and painters committed majestic depictions of the siege to canvas. In 1882, its ruins were declared a national monument\u2019 and became a pilgrimage site for Spanish patriots. In the 1950s and 1960s, the most popular comic books in Spain weren\u2019t about Superman and Spiderman \u2013 they told of the adventures of El Jabato, an imaginary ancient Iberian hero who fought against the Roman oppressors. The ancient Numantians are to this day Spain\u2019s paragons of heroism and patriotism, cast as role models for the country\u2019s young people. Yet Spanish patriots extol the Numantians in Spanish \u2013 a romance language that is a progeny of Scipio\u2019s Latin. The Numantians spoke a now dead and lost Celtic language. Cervantes wrote The Siege of Numantia in Latin script, and the play follows Graeco-Roman artistic models. Numantia had no theatres. Spanish patriots who admire Numantian heroism tend also to be loyal followers of the Roman Catholic Church \u2013 don\u2019t miss that first word \u2013 a church whose leader still sits in Rome and whose God prefers to be addressed in Latin. Similarly, modern Spanish law derives from Roman law; Spanish politics is built on Roman foundations; and Spanish cuisine and architecture owe a far greater debt to Roman legacies than to those of the Celts of Iberia. Nothing is really left of Numantia save ruins. Even its story has reached us thanks only to the writings of Roman historians. It was tailored to the tastes of Roman audiences which relished tales of freedom-loving barbarians. The victory of Rome over Numantia was so complete that the victors co-opted the very memory of the vanquished. It\u2019s not our kind of story. We like to see underdogs win. But there is no justice in history. Most past cultures have sooner or later fallen prey to the armies of some ruthless empire, which have consigned them to oblivion. Empires, too, ultimately fall, but they tend to leave behind rich and enduring legacies. Almost all people in the twenty-first century are the offspring of one empire or another.\"",
        "\"The Worship of Man\nThe last 300 years are often depicted as an age of growing secularism, in which religions have increasingly lost their importance. If we are talking about theist religions, this is largely correct. But if we take into consideration natural-law religions, then modernity turns out to be an age of intense religious fervour, unparalleled missionary efforts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.\n\nIslam is of course different from Communism, because Islam sees the superhuman order governing the world as the edict of an omnipotent creator god, whereas Soviet Communism did not believe in gods. But Buddhism too gives short shrift to gods, and yet we commonly classify it as a religion. Like Buddhists, Communists believed in a superhuman order of natural and immutable laws that should guide human actions. Whereas Buddhists believe that the law of nature was discovered by Siddhartha Gautama, Communists believed that the law of nature was discovered by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The similarity does not end there. Like other religions, Communism too has its holy scripts and prophetic books, such as Marx\u2019s Das Kapital, which foretold that history would soon end with the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Communism had its holidays and festivals, such as the First of May and the anniversary of the October Revolution. It had theologians adept at Marxist dialectics, and every unit in the Soviet army had a chaplain, called a commissar, who monitored the piety of soldiers and officers. Communism had martyrs, holy wars and heresies, such as Trotskyism. Soviet Communism was a fanatical and missionary religion. A devout Communist could not be a Christian or a Buddhist, and was expected to spread the gospel of Marx and Lenin even at the price of his or her life.\n\nSome readers may feel very uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. If it makes you feel better, you are free to go on calling Communism an ideology rather than a religion. It makes no difference. We can divide creeds into god-centred religions and godless ideologies that claim to be based on natural laws. But then, to be consistent, we would need to catalogue at least some Buddhist, Daoist and Stoic sects as ideologies rather than religions. Conversely, we should note that belief in gods persists within many modern ideologies, and that some of them, most notably liberalism, make little sense without this belief.\"",

We no longer say, \u2018It\u2019s in their blood.\u2019 We say, \u2018It\u2019s in their culture.\u2019\n\nThus European right-wing parties which oppose Muslim immigration usually take care to avoid racial terminology. Marine le Pen\u2019s speechwriters would have been shown the door on the spot had they suggested that the leader of the Front National go on television to declare that, \u2018We don\u2019t want those inferior Semites to dilute our Aryan blood and spoil our Aryan civilisation.\u2019 Instead, the French Front National, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alliance for the Future of Austria and their like tend to argue that Western culture, as it has evolved in Europe, is characterised by democratic values, tolerance and gender equality, whereas Muslim culture, which evolved in the Middle East, is characterised by hierarchical politics, fanaticism and misogyny. Since the two cultures are so different, and since many Muslim immigrants are unwilling (and perhaps unable) to adopt Western values, they should not be allowed to enter, lest they foment internal conflicts and corrode European democracy and liberalism. Such culturist arguments are fed by scientific studies in the humanities and social sciences that highlight the so-called clash of civilisations and the fundamental differences between different cultures. Not all historians and anthropologists accept these theories or support their political usages. But whereas biologists today have an easy time disavowing racism, simply explaining that the biological differences between present-day human populations are trivial, it is harder for historians and anthropologists to disavow culturism. After all, if the differences between human cultures are trivial, why should we pay historians and anthropologists to study them?\"",
        "\"In Hindu polytheism, a single principle, Atman, controls the myriad gods and spirits, humankind, and the biological and physical world. Atman is the eternal essence or soul of the entire universe, as well as of every individual and every phenomenon.\nmonotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans. It\u2019s pointless to ask this power for victory in war, for health or for rain, because from its all-encompassing vantage point, it makes no difference whether a particular kingdom wins or loses, whether a particular city prospers or withers, whether a particular person recuperates or dies. The Greeks did not waste any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman. The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good \u2013 to embrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death. Thus some Hindus, known as Sadhus or Sannyasis, devote their lives to uniting with Atman, thereby achieving enlightenment. They strive to see the world from the viewpoint of this fundamental principle, to realise that from its eternal perspective all mundane desires and fears are meaningless and ephemeral phenomena.\"\n\nThe insight of polytheism is conducive to far-reaching religious tolerance. Since polytheists believe, on the one hand, in one supreme and completely disinterested power, and on the other hand in many partial and biased powers, there is no difficulty for the devotees of one god to accept the existence and efficacy of other gods. Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes \u2018heretics\u2019 and \u2018infidels\u2019.\"",
        "\"In Aldous Huxley\u2019s dystopian novel Brave New World, published in 1932 at the height of the Great Depression, happiness is the supreme value and psychiatric drugs replace the police and the ballot as the foundation of politics.\nEach day, each person takes a dose of \u2018soma\u2019, a synthetic drug which makes people happy without harming their productivity and efficiency. The World State that governs the entire globe is never threatened by wars, revolutions, strikes or demonstrations, because all people are supremely content with their current conditions, whatever they may be. Huxley\u2019s vision of the future is far more troubling than George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Huxley\u2019s world seems monstrous to most readers, but it is hard to explain why. Everybody is happy all the time \u2013 what could be wrong with that?\n\nHuxley\u2019s disconcerting world is based on the biological assumption that happiness equals pleasure. To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant bodily sensations. Since our biochemistry limits the volume and duration of these sensations, the only way to make people experience a high level of happiness over an extended period of time is to manipulate their biochemical system. But that definition of happiness is contested by some scholars. In a famous study, Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, asked people to recount a typical work day, going through it episode by episode and evaluating how much they enjoyed or disliked each moment. He discovered what seems to be a paradox in most people\u2019s view of their lives. Take the work involved in raising a child. Kahneman found that when counting moments of joy and moments of drudgery, bringing up a child turns out to be a rather unpleasant affair. It consists largely of changing nappies, washing dishes and dealing with temper tantrums, which nobody likes to do. Yet most parents declare that their children are their chief source of happiness. Does it mean that people don\u2019t really know what\u2019s good for them? That\u2019s one option. Another is that the findings demonstrate that happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in seeing one\u2019s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. There is an important cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the difference to whether we see ourselves as \u2018miserable slaves to a baby dictator\u2019 or as \u2018lovingly nurturing a new life\u2019. As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.\"",
        "\"According to Buddhism, most people identify happiness with pleasant feelings, while identifying suffering with unpleasant feelings.\nPeople consequently ascribe immense importance to what they feel, craving to experience more and more pleasures, while avoiding pain. Whatever we do throughout our lives, whether scratching our leg, fidgeting slightly in the chair, or fighting world wars, we are just trying to get pleasant feelings. The problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more than fleeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If five minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles. What is so important about obtaining such ephemeral prizes? Why struggle so hard to achieve something that disappears almost as soon as it arises? According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them.\n\nThis is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices. In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body, witness the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and realise how pointless it is to pursue them. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied. All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing \u2013 joy, anger, boredom, lust \u2013 but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can just accept them for what they are. You live in the present moment instead of fantasising about what might have been. The resulting serenity is so profound that those who spend their lives in the frenzied pursuit of pleasant feelings can hardly imagine it. It is like a man standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain \u2018good\u2019 waves and trying to prevent them from disintegrating, while simultaneously pushing back \u2018bad\u2019 waves to prevent them from getting near him. Day in, day out, the man stands on the beach, driving himself crazy with this fruitless exercise. Eventually, he sits down on the sand and just allows the waves to come and go as they please. How peaceful!\n\nBuddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha\u2019s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.\"",

Never before has such a mighty empire disappeared so swiftly and so quietly.\nThe Soviet Empire of 1989 had suffered no military defeat except in Afghanistan, no external invasions, no rebellions, nor even large-scale Martin Luther King-style campaigns of civil disobedience. The Soviets still had millions of soldiers, tens of thousands of tanks and aeroplanes, and enough nuclear weapons to wipe out the whole of humankind several times over. The Red Army and the other Warsaw Pact armies remained loyal. Had the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev, given the order, the Red Army would have opened fire on the subjugated masses. Yet the Soviet elite, and the Communist regimes through most of eastern Europe (Romania and Serbia were the exceptions), chose not to use even a tiny fraction of this military power. When its members realised that Communism was bankrupt, they renounced force, admitted their failure, packed their suitcases and went home. Gorbachev and his colleagues gave up without a struggle not only the Soviet conquests of World War Two, but also the much older tsarist conquests in the Baltic, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is chilling to contemplate what might have happened if Gorbachev had behaved like the Serbian leadership \u2013 or like the French in Algeria.\"",

The World Controller has a pleasant chat with John, explaining that if he insists on being antisocial, he should just remove himself to some secluded place and live as a hermit. John then questions the views that underlie the global order, and accuses the World Government that in its pursuit of happiness, it has eliminated not just truth and beauty, but all that is noble and heroic in life:\n\n\u2018My dear young friend,\u2019 said Mustapha Mond, \u2018civilization has absolutely\nno need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political\ninefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any\nopportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be\nthoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars,\nwhere there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be\nresisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended \u2013 there, obviously,\nnobility and heroism have some sense.

The key observation is that you have to get to the cutting edge of a field before its adjacent possible\u2014and the innovations it contains\u2014becomes visible. In the context of career construction, it\u2019s important to note that good career missions are also often found in the adjacent possible. The implication, therefore, is that if you want to find a mission in your career, you first need to get to the cutting edge of your field.\n\nlittle bets : An idea borrowed from the business writer Peter Sims. When Sims studied innovative corporations and people, he noted the following: \u201cRather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins\u201d [emphasis mine].

This mindset stands in contrast to the craftsman mindset. The passion mindset ultimately leads to chronic dissatisfaction and daydreaming about the better jobs you imagine existing out there waiting to be discovered.\n\ncareer capital : A description of the skills you have that are rare and valuable to the working world. This is the key currency for creating work you love.\n\nthe career capital theory of great work : This theory provides the foundation for all of the ideas that follow it in this book. It claims that the key to work you love is not to follow your passion, but instead to get good at something rare and valuable, and then cash in the \u201ccareer capital\u201d this generates to acquire the traits that define great jobs. This requires that you approach work with a craftsman mindset (focusing on your value to the world) and not a passion mindset (focusing on what value the world is offering you). Here is the formal three-part definition of the theory :\n\n- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.\n- Supply and demand says that if you want these traits, you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.\n- The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on being \u201cso good they can\u2019t ignore you,\u201d is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to have work you love.\n\nthe 10,000-hour rule : A rule, well-known to performance scientists, describing the amount of practice time required to master a skill. Malcolm Gladwell, who popularized the concept in his 2008 book Outliers, described it as follows: \u201cThe idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in studies of expertise. In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours.\u201d\n\ndeliberate practice : The style of difficult practice required to continue to improve at a task. Florida State University professor Anders Ericsson, who coined the term in the early 1990s, describes it formally as an \u201cactivity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual\u2019s performance.\u201d Deliberate practice requires you to stretch past where you are comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance. In the context of career construction, most knowledge workers avoid this style of skill development because, quite frankly, it\u2019s uncomfortable. To build up large stores of career capital, however, which is necessary for creating work you love, you must make this style of practice a regular part of your work routine.\n\ncareer capital markets : When acquiring career capital in a field, you can envision that you\u2019re acquiring this capital in a specific type of career capital market. There are two types of these markets: winner-take-all and auction. In a winner-take-all market, there is only one type of career capital available and lots of different people competing for it. An auction market, by contrast, is less structured: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate their own unique collection of this capital. Different markets require different career capital acquisition strategies. In a winner-take-all market, for example, you need to first \u201ccrack the code\u201d on how people master the one skill that matters. In an auction market, by contrast, you might simply emphasize rareness in the skill combinations that you create.\"",
        "\"Self-Determination Theory (SDT) tells us that motivation, in the workplace or elsewhere, requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs - factors described as the 'nutriments' required to feel intrinsically motivated for your work:\n- Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important\n- Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do\n- Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people\n\nScientists did not find \u201cmatching work to pre-existing passions\u201d as being important for motivation. The traits they did find, by contrast, are more general and are agnostic to the specific type of work in question.

One camp thought tournament play was crucial, as it provides practice with tight time limits and working through distractions. The other camp, however, emphasized serious study\u2014pouring over books and using teachers to help identify and then eliminate weaknesses. When surveyed, the participants in study thought tournament play was probably the right answer. The participants, as it turns out, were wrong. Hours spent in serious study of the game was not just the most important factor in predicting chess skill, it dominated the other factors. The researchers discovered that the players who became grand masters spent five times more hours dedicated to serious study than those who plateaued at an intermediate level.

Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.\n\nEach of these maps is based on the stimulus/response theory we most often think of in connection with Pavlov\u2019s experiments with dogs.

And best of all, you got prepared with no late nights, no all-day study grinds, and no caffeine-induced hallucinations that your art history textbook is trying to poison you. Studying two weeks in advance may sound crazy at first. But once you realize that you are just spreading the necessary work out over time, not increasing the total amount of work you do, you should come to understand that this approach is a painless and highly effective method for test preparation. If you fear that you lack the willpower to get started so early, I challenge you to try this approach just once. Do it for a test early in the term when you don't feel so overwhelmed by other obligations.

If you find yourself falling behind the professor's chalkboard heroics, ramp up the amount of preparatory reading you are doing until you are able to comfortably follow along.

It's easy to write a good paper but touch on the wrong topics. Or to fly through a big math problem with ease but use the wrong algorithm. Bad grades happen, and this shouldn't be a big deal. As long as you put in the effort, who cares about one bad day?\n\nI once met a particularly awe-inspiring Rhodes Scholar who delighted in telling the story of how she bombed her final exam in a calculus course. Did this disaster ruin her academic career? Not at all. She may have made some dumb mistakes on one test, but in the end, she made sure she eventually conquered those concepts. In fact, the first step she took after her ill-fated exam was to head straight to her professor's office hours. She went over the exam with him in detail, separating dumb mistakes from actual misunderstandings and discussing the right answers until she felt in control of the material. She demonstrated so much enthusiasm for the subject that the professor invited her back to be a teaching assistant the next semester, even though her grade in the class wasn't anywhere near the A- usually required for becoming a T.A.\n\nThe point is that she didn't care about getting a bad grade. Her concern was with understanding the material. This focus on learning for the sake of learning, not for the sake of grades, may not have made her Valedictorian, but it did propel her to a diverse and exciting collegiate career\u2014not to mention quite a few national awards and honors. If you begin to obsess about your G.P.A., much of the excitement of college is lost. Every test stops being an opportunity to show off your ability to engage the material, and instead becomes a potential devastation to your overall academic standing. Every paper stops being an exercise in crafting words, and instead creates recurring fear that you might have come to the wrong conclusion. And at the end of every term you will exist in a state of nervous apprehension as you wait for your final grades to be released. In short, obsessing about your G.P.A. makes your life stressful and can derail you from your larger goals. If you want to be a successful student, forget about your G.P.A. Ignore it. Don't talk about it. Make no attempt to know the numbers. You should approach your collegiate career with confidence and energy.When you have the occasional academic misstep, never look back, just move on.

        "\" Daily to-do lists do not work at college. Your schedule is too complicated and too unpredictable.\nSome assignments could easily take up your entire evening, while others may take just minutes. Friends will drop by unexpectedly, meals will last for hours, and interesting opportunities for fun will pop up at the last moment. A to-do list can't tame this hectic lifestyle. If you blindly move through the day, trying to accomplish tasks from a list whenever it seems like you have some free time, you will get very little done. Here is a better way to take control of your schedule: Every morning, before your first class, rip a sheet of paper out of your notebook. Go down the left-hand margin marking the waking hours of the day using every other line as a guide. Now block out the hours you will be in class. Then block out the hours you will be eating meals, and when you will be in meetings or other scheduled events. The white space that remains represents the free time that you have available to work with for the day. This is a great way to visualize your schedule. Now, start partitioning this free time into one-hour increments, and assign these blocks to specific projects and assignments. Set aside at least one block for accomplishing small chores or errands. Next to this space write a small to-do list of the little tasks you need to get done that day. This ensures that even when you have huge projects to work on, the little tasks that keep your world running\u2014buying toothpaste or returning library books\u2014 will not be neglected. Keep this sheet with you and reference it throughout the day to guide your work habits. If you get knocked off schedule, which will happen frequently, simply take out your sheet at the next available calm moment and spend half a minute reorganizing your time for the remaining hours of the day. This approach only takes two paragraphs to explain, and just minutes a day to implement, but it is exponentially more effective than daily to-do lists. Unless you're a big fan of stress, do yourself a favor and give time-blocking a try. It's a much smarter way to manage your day.\"",

        "\"If you want to succeed at college, you have to develop a healthy sense of self-confidence. This doesn't mean you should be arrogant\u2014such people are often secretly insecure.\nInstead, you want to be self-assured, proud, and modest all at the same time. These are the traits of a well-liked, successful student.\n\nOne good technique for bolstering your confidence is mastering a skill. Develop a skill you can be known for. Again, this is not about bragging rights. People can know you are good at something without you having to constantly remind them. This is about reinforcing your identity and sense of self-confidence.\n\nWhy is this so important? Because college is an overwhelming social environment. You are thrown into a small space with thousands of other students who know nothing about you. Many students fail to maintain a strong sense of identity in this situation, and instead begin to peg their self-worth on receiving the respect and admiration of others. If you're invited to a hot party, do well on a test, or catch the eye of that cute girl ahead of you in the lunch line, you feel good about yourself. But if you end up with no plans for Friday night, bomb a test, or realize that the cute girl was actually smiling at her bodybuilder boyfriend standing right behind you, well, then you feel pretty lousy. The state of your self-esteem is like a roller-coaster ride, differing from day to day depending on events beyond your control. You cannot win at college with this mind-set.\n\nWhen you are dependent on good things happening to make you feel good, your life becomes centered on preserving a good mood. This will constrain you, because if you are constantly worried about avoiding anything negative, you will never do anything out of the ordinary. Standout students, on the other hand, do very little that is ordinary. This is what makes them so phenomenal. They find better ways, uncover new approaches, and question everything. The only way to develop such an aggressive mind-set is to have a strong sense of self-confidence to back you up.\n\nDeveloping these traits is not easy. But doing one thing better than anyone else you know is an excellent start toward accomplishing this goal. By mastering one activity in your life, you are putting a stake into the ground, giving yourself one thing to feel sure of, and making a declaration about who you are. Don't let others dictate how you should feel about yourself; strengthen your identity\u2014 then go conquer your world.\"",

And he finally rewarded me with a simple piece of advice: \u201cDon't have regrets.\u201d This sage quip had been passed to him by a family friend whom he greatly admired, and he had taken the words to heart.\n\nTo not have \u201cregrets\u201d is to approach life with a sense of excitement and possibility. It's to be happy about your opportunities, not your successes. The fact that you are able to have the experience of going for a major award, pursuing an interesting research project, or starting a student organization is a great affirmation of your zest for life. If you fail, why waste time with regrets? Be thankful for the experience and ask what's next?\n\nI conclude this book with these words because I believe that pursuing your ambitions for the right reasons is more important than any specific strategy for succeeding at college. If you want to succeed because you like the attention, then this book can't help you. If you want succeed to prove yourself to others, then this book can't help you. If you want to succeed because you enjoy adulation and praise, then this book can't help you. You will never really win, because the fear of failure will always be lurking around the next corner.\n\nIf, however, you want to succeed because you love the excitement of pushing your potential and exploring your world and new experiences, if you want to succeed because life is short and why not fill it with as much activity as possible, then you will win. If you approach life with an attitude of never having regrets and always having a hopeful smile on your face, you can find a measure of success in all your endeavors. Don't have regrets, but have plenty of fun along the way. In the end, that is what it is to really win.\"",

        "\"You need look no further than the quiz-and-recall method. The details of this approach are simple.\nFor any material you have to learn, be it complicated social science theories, foreign language verb conjugations, or physics equations, your basic study method should always involve quizzing and recalling. I don't mean this lightly. Asking yourself a handful of review questions doesn't count. You should build your entire approach to studying around the concept that making yourself recall specific information is the absolute best way to learn.\n\nThis approach turns studying into a two-step process. The first step is the long and silent review of all the material that is going to be on the test. While you do this review, jot down your recall questions. If you ask about a topic from a specific book, jot down the page number where the answer can be found. If you ask about something from your notes, jot down the date of the relevant lecture. This will save a lot of time when you forget an answer later on.\n\nThe next step of the process is the quizzing. This is where the real learning actually happens. When quizzing yourself, you don't necessarily have to write down your answers. This might be necessary for solving math problems, but for discussion-style questions, feel free to formulate your response out loud. You can cover topics much quicker when you just have to talk as opposed to write. However, if speaking out loud, it's important that you still use complete sentences. The more clearly you articulate your thoughts, the more clearly you remember the information.\n\nThis technique is remarkably effective because it forces you to recall the information from scratch. The act of pulling the information from your memory and articulating the main points cements knowledge much stronger than just reading it over a couple of times. Reviewing notes on a topic can only take you so far. Your mind is perfectly willing to read the same words hundreds of times without making any real effort to remember them. But if you actually make yourself stare at a blank sheet of paper and recall answers from no other source than your brain, you will remember that material. This is guaranteed. Another trick is to involve emotion. Don't just sit at a desk and talk quietly. Stand up, pace your room, yell out answers, cover material as if lecturing to a fascinated class, and play inspiring music in the background. The more stimuli you provide your brain, the more connections to the material you will develop, and the better you will remember and understand it.\n\nIn fact, this technique saves you time and provides peace of mind. Your goal for studying is no longer an amorphous promise to \u201creview all the relevant material\u201d; instead, it's the much more specific \u201creview all the relevant material until I can ace all my quizzes.\u201d If you can pass your quizzes in two hours, then you are done studying in two hours. If it takes you three days, then you are done studying in three days\u2014but at least at the end you will know you are ready. The quiz-and-recall method is near miraculous in its ability to consistently provide you with top results. And if you are innovative in your attempts to keep your energy level high while recalling the information, it can even be, dare we say it, fun. Whatever else you do to study, never approach an exam without first having made yourself recall all the relevant information from scratch.\"",

Avoid the descent by making this rule nonnegotiable. If you skip class for no good reason, even once, attendance for every class suddenly becomes debatable.

        "\"Some students believe it's beneficial to maintain \u201cintellectual momentum\u201d by studying right up until the testing begins. This is not true. Such an approach releases too much adrenaline, which makes you jittery and unfocused.\nThe best state for your mind to be in is confident and calm. Take the hour before an exam to relax.\n\nThink of it as an Olympic athlete would, training for the mile-run. In the weeks leading up to the competition the athlete trains hard. But on the day of the race, he rests and conserves his energy so that he can be ready to compete hard when the starting gun fires.

Have a conversation with a friend. Work on unrelated\u2014 nondemanding\u2014schoolwork. The key is to keep your mind active and energized, but not exhausted. Then head over to the exam fifteen minutes early. On the way, start to lightly review some material that you feel particularly good about. Imagine yourself writing a strong essay on this topic, imagine the professor handing the class a copy of your essay as an example of a good answer. This technique is more than just shameless ego-stroking, it builds your confidence, and, more important, it warms up your mind in a good and controlled sort of way. When you arrive at the test location, avoid the temptation to frantically catalog all the concepts you are a little shaky on. Try to keep your mind blank, or, alternatively, continue thinking confidence-boosting thoughts about doing really well. When the exam is finally handed out, take a deep breath and have at it. You should be mentally nimble, rested, and energized by the time your pen hits the paper. Most students neglect this psychological component of exams. To only study the material but not prepare your mind for the stress of the test-taking experience, means you are only partially prepared to do your best. Taking the time to relax and then to carefully reenergize right before an exam is a great way to consistently score well.\"",

        "\"We talked about consistently sleeping the right number of hours, eating the proper food, exercising, and avoiding the naps and all-nighters that destroy your sleep cycle.\nThroughout this book we have discussed your body as if you are trying to extract maximum performance from a demanding machine. Now it's time for a body-related rule that won't make you cringe: Relax for at least half an hour before you go to sleep. When you schedule each day you should always indicate a cutoff point when you will stop all work. On a light day, early in a semester or right after exams, this cutoff may be relatively early in the evening. Which is great, go out and enjoy! But during the inevitable busy stretches, you will always have more work than you can accomplish on any given day, so for your own well-being you have to impose a deadline on your daily chaos. For me, during finals and midterms, this cutoff was usually around eleven P.M., but the specific time really depends on the urgency of your workload and when you typically go to bed. Here is what's important: after you pass your daily work cutoff point, never move right into sleep. If you go to bed with the stresses of the day fresh on your mind, you will have a harder time falling asleep, and psychologically you deny your mind the chance to recover from the pressures of the day. Instead, you should always relax for at least half an hour before going to sleep. Watch a TV show, read, play your guitar, talk to a friend. It doesn't matter what you do, as long as it doesn't involve any schoolwork and it makes you happy. Furthermore, really make an effort during this time to completely block out thoughts about upcoming obligations or work deadlines. Some of the happiest and most successful students I have ever met possess an almost superhuman ability to shut off stressful thoughts once they decide they are done for the day. This is a practiced skill, one you should work on. When you consistently fall asleep relaxed, you sleep better, you are happier, and you have more energy the next day. The work lost to your nighttime relaxation will be more than compensated for by your refreshed spirit the next morning.\"",
        "\"Schedule your free time. Most people consider free time to be any time when they are not explicitly working. All you need to do is flip this understanding, and say that work time is any time that you are not explicitly relaxing.\nWhen you create your schedule each morning, you need to do two things. First, choose an end point for the day. For example, you might say that ten P.M. is the end of your workday, and from that point on you will just relax until you go to sleep. Second, decide exactly when you are going to relax throughout the day. For example, you might decide that you will spend a half hour after lunch watching TV, two hours in the afternoon to go to the gym and hang out with friends, and an hour or two surrounding dinner to unwind. The rest of your time you will be working. As you move through your day, there will never be any question as to whether you should be relaxing. Either you are in one of your scheduled break periods, or you are working. Not only does this cut down on impromptu breaks, but it can also increase your work ethic\u2014everyone works harder right before a scheduled reprieve. By reversing the way you think about free time, not only will you work more, but when you do relax, you will relax better. There is no fear that you are being irresponsible, or neglecting something important. Scheduling your free time may sound a little scary at first, but it shouldn't. You are not actually reducing\u2014or increasing\u2014the amount of free time you have during the day, you are just labeling and consolidating it so you can maximize the benefits of kicking back. Scheduling your free time is quite simply a win-win proposition, and a great way to painlessly improve your productivity.\"",
        "\"Set arbitrary deadlines.\nThis technique is simple in concept and surprisingly effective in practice. When you have a long-term project to work on, establish from the outset several nonnegotiable intermediate deadlines. Nothing is actually due on these deadlines, but they will exist as a nearby landmark to help you focus on nearterm goals. The positive effect is powerful. Imagine the mental difference between having a paper due in three weeks, and having three days to solidify a thesis statement. Or imagine the difference between having a month to finish a big computer science programming project and having five days to build the user interface component. The former is daunting and invites procrastination, the latter is approachable and motivating. This is not about tricking yourself into thinking you have something due when no actual deadline exists. It's about breaking large projects into smaller, short-term goals you can easily accomplish. By setting arbitrary deadlines, you blur the distinction between small and large assignments, and turn your schedule into one manageable flow of many small tasks. This is a fundamentally smarter way to handle your work.\"",

What is not so obvious is how easy it can be to blow the curve on a regular basis. The key is to pick your spots. To do an outstanding job on every assignment in every class you take would be near impossible. Most assignments are not easily dominated. And to turn heads in a class that is giving you particular trouble, or does not interest you, is difficult. However, it's not so hard to do an outstanding job in a class that you really enjoy, on a project that excites you, assigned during a time where you don't have many competing obligations.\n\nWith this in mind, every semester you should choose one class that you like, and within that class choose one interesting project, and then knock it out of the ballpark. Get started very early, work diligently, go above and beyond the stated specifications, and add on extra work to show true intellectual curiosity.\n\nIf you are working on a computer science programming assignment, schedule yourself to finish a week early so you can add a host of extra bells and whistles. To focus on just one project each term is not all that demanding on your time or energy, especially if you plan ahead and choose an appropriate target.

        "\"The Nine Golden Keys to Making Great First Impressions for an Interview\nMost job interviews are non-productive because studies show a strong correlation between how much the interviewer likes the interviewee and whether or not they get the job. In the end, most of the factual information that comes from the curriculum vitae \u2014 the real stuff about the candidate that is a good indicator of performance - is forgotten. What is remembered is the impression the candidate made on the interview. Let's assume you're going to an interview and you want to make the best first impression. Keep in mind that others form up to 90% of their opinion about you in the first four minutes and that 60 to 80% of the impact you will make is non-verbal. Here are nine Golden Keys to getting it right first time in an interview:\n\n1.  In the Reception Area\n\nRemove your outerwear and give it to the receptionist if possible. Avoid entering an office with your arms full of clutter that can make you fumble and look inept. Always stand in a reception area \u2014 never sit. Receptionists will insist you 'take a seat' because when you do, you're out of sight and they no longer have to deal with you. Stand with Hand-in-Hand behind your back (confidence) and slowly rock back and forth on your feet (confident, controlled) or use the Steeple gesture. This body language is a constant reminder that you are still there and waiting. But never do this at the Tax Office.\n\n2.The Entry\n\nYour entry tells others how you expect to be treated. When the receptionist has given you the green light to enter, walk in without hesitation. Do not stand in the doorway like a naughty schoolchild waiting to see the headmaster. When you walk through the door of the person's office, maintain the same speed. People who lack confidence change gears and perform a small shuffle as they enter.\n\n3.The Approach\n\nEven if the person is on the phone, rummaging through a drawer or tying his shoelaces, walk in directly and confidently with a smooth motion. Put down your briefcase, folder or what- ever is in your hands, shake the person's hand and immediately take a seat. Let the other person see that you are accustomed to walking confidently into offices and that you don't expect to be kept waiting. People who walk slowly or take long strides convey that they have plenty of time on their hands, are not interested in what they are doing or have nothing else to do. This is fine for retired millionaires and those who live in Florida and Queensland, but not for anyone who wants to convey power, authority or capability or that they are a healthy, potential mate. Influential people and those who command attention walk briskly at a medium pace with medium length strides.\n\n4.The Handshake\n\nKeep your palm straight and return the pressure you receive. Let the other person decide when to end the handshake. Step to the left of a rectangular desk as you approach to avoid being given a Palm-Down handshake. Never shake directly across a desk. Use a person's name twice in the first 15 seconds and never talk for more than 30 seconds at a time.\n\n5.  When You Sit\n\nIf you are compelled to sit in a low chair directly facing the other person, turn it away 45 degrees from the person to avoid being stuck in the 'reprimand' position. If you can't angle the chair, angle your body instead.\n\n6.  Seating Areas\n\nIf you're invited to sit in an informal area of the person's office, such as at an informal coffee table, this is a positive sign because 95% of business rejections are delivered from behind a desk. Never sit on a low sofa that sinks so low it makes you look like a giant pair of legs topped by a small head - if nec- essary, sit upright on the edge so you can control your body language and gestures, and angle your body to 45 degrees away from the person.\n\n7.Your Gestures\n\nPeople who are cool, calm, collected and in control of their emotions use clear, uncomplicated, deliberate movements. High-status individuals use fewer gestures than low-status individuals. This is an ancient negotiating ploy \u2014 people with power don't have to move much. Keep in mind that Eastern Europeans gesture more from the elbow down than Westerners, and Southern Europeans gesture more with their entire arms and shoulders. Mirror the other person's gestures and expressions when appropriate.\n\n8.  Distance\n\nRespect the other person's Personal Space, which will be largest in the opening minutes of the meeting. If you move too close, the person will respond by sitting back, leaning away or using repetitive gestures such as drumming the fingers. As a rule, you can move closer to familiar people but further back from new ones. Men generally move closer to women they work with while women generally move further back when they work with men. Work closer to those of similar age and further back from significantly older or younger ones.\n\n9.Your Exit\n\nPack your things calmly and deliberately - not in a frenzy - shake hands if possible, turn and walk out. If the door was closed when you entered, close it behind you as you leave. People always watch you from behind as you leave so, if you're a man, make sure you have shined the back of your shoes. This is an area many men neglect and women are critical of this.\"",
        "\"If you are asked to address an audience at any time, it's important to understand how an audience receives and retains information.\nFirst, never tell the audience you feel nervous or overawed - they'll start looking for nervous body language and will be sure to find it. They'll never suspect you're nervous unless you tell them. Second, use confidence gestures as you speak, even if you're feeling terrified. Use Steeple gestures, open and closed palm positions, occasional Protruding Thumbs and keep your arms unfolded. Avoid pointing at the audience, arm crossing, face touching and lectern gripping.\u00a0\"",

In other words, whether we realise it or not, we automatically copy the facial expressions we see. This is why regular smiling is important to have as a part of your body language repertoire, even when you don't feel like it, because smiling directly influences other people's attitudes and how they respond to you. Science has proved that the more you smile, the more positive reactions others will give you.

        "\"Seven Simple Strategies for Giving You the Extra Edge\n1. Stand up for Meetings\n\nConduct all short-term decision-making meetings standing up. Studies show that standing conversations are significantly shorter than sitting ones and the person who conducts a stand- ing meeting is perceived as having higher status than those who sit. Standing whenever others enter your workspace is also an excellent timesaver, so consider having no visitors' chairs in your own work area. Standing decisions are quick and to the point and others don't waste your time with social chatter or questions such as 'How's the family?'\n\n2. Sit Competitors with Their Backs to the Door\n\nStudies reveal that when our backs are towards an open space we become stressed, blood pressure increases, our heart beats faster, our brainwave output increases and we breathe more quickly as our body readies itself for a possible rear attack. This is an excellent position in which to place your opponents.\n\n3. Keep Your Fingers Together\n\nPeople who keep their fingers closed when they talk with their hands and keep their hands below chin level, command the most attention. Using open fingers or having your hands held above the chin is perceived as less powerful.\n\n4. Keep Your Elbows Out\n\nWhen you sit on a chair, keep your elbows out or on the armsof the chair. Submissive, timid individuals keep their elbows in to protect themselves and are perceived as fearful.\n\n5. Use Power Words\n\nA study at the University of California showed that the most persuasive words in spoken language are: discovery, guarantee, love, proven, results, save, easy, health, money, new,\n\nsafety and you. Practise using these words. The new results you'll get from the discovery of these proven words will guarantee you more love, better health and will save you money. And they're completely safe, and easy to use.\n\n6. Carry a Slim Briefcase\n\nA slim briefcase with a combination lock is carried by an important person who is concerned only with the bottom-line details; large, bulky briefcases are carried by those who do all the work and are perceived as not being sufficiently organised to get things done on time.\n\n7. Watch Their Coat Buttons\n\nAnalysis of videotaped confrontations, for example, between unions and corporations, show a higher frequency of agree- ment is reached when people have their coats unbuttoned. People who cross their arms on their chest often do it with their jacket buttoned and are more negative. When a person suddenly unbuttons their jacket in a meeting, you can reason- ably assume that they have also just opened their mind.\n\nBefore you go to an important interview or meeting, sit quietly for five minutes and mentally practise seeing yourself doing these things and doing them well. When your mind sees them clearly, your body will be able to carry them out and others will react accordingly.\"",

In this way the agent has signalled that he expects the results to be to your benefit.

        "\"The Attraction Process\nAs with other animals, human courtship follows a predictable five-step sequence that we all go through when we meet an attractive person.\n\nStage 1. Eye contact: She looks across the room and spots a man she fancies. She waits till he notices her then holds his gaze for about five seconds and then turns away. He now keeps watching her to see if she does it again. A woman needs to deliver this gaze, on average, three times before the average man realises what's happening. This gaze process can be repeated several times and is the start of the flirting process.\n\nStage 2. Smiling: She delivers one or more fleeting smiles. This is a quick half smile that is intended to give a prospective man the green light to make an approach. Unfortunately, many men are not responsive to these signals, leaving the woman feeling that he's not interested in her.\n\nStage 3. Preening: She sits up straight to emphasise her breasts and crosses her legs or ankles to show them to best advantage or, if she's standing, she tilts her hips and tilts her head sideways towards one shoulder, exposing her bare neck. She plays with her hair for up to six seconds \u2014 suggesting she is grooming herself for her man. She may lick her lips, flick her hair and straighten her clothing and jewellery. He'll respond with gestures such as standing up straight, pulling his stomach in, expanding his chest, adjusting his clothing, touching his hair and tucking his thumbs into his belt. They both point their feet or entire bodies towards each other.\n\nStage 4. Talk: He approaches and attempts to make small talk, using cliches such as, 'Haven't I seen you somewhere before?' and other well-worn lines that are purely intended to break the ice.\n\nStage 5. Touch: She looks for an opportunity to initiate a light touch on the arm, either 'accidental' or otherwise. A hand touch indicates a higher level of intimacy than a touch on the arm. Each level of touch is then repeated to check that the person is happy with this level of intimacy and to let them know that the first touch was not accidental. Lightly brushing or touching the shoulder of a man is done to give the impression that the woman cares about his health and appearance. Shaking hands is a quick way to move to the touch stage.\n\nThese first five stages of courtship may seem minor or even incidental but they are critical to starting any new relationship and are the stages that most people, especially men, find difficult.\"",

        "\"There are two small countries situated to the north of India, namely, Bhutan and Nepal.\nThese countries are small in size, but are inhabited by a brave, strong, and warlike people. During the present British rule of India, Britain often went to Nepal in search of soldiers in order to rule the Indians. A great deal of money by way of subsidies had to be spent before Britain was allowed to dispatch a political observer to Nepal. Even a great Power such as Great Britain had to respect her; Nepal was, in fact, a great Power in Asia. But what is the attitude of Nepal toward Great Britain during the past hundred years? Over hundred years ago India was conquered by Great Britain, and during this period Nepal was able to live peacefully on the border of the British colony. Although hundred years have passed, Nepal has never sent tribute to Great Britain. Great Britain, on the other hand, has to spend a large 'sum by way of subsidies to Nepal. But what is the attitude of Nepal toward China? The status of China has deteriorated to such an extent that it is now inferior even to that of a British colony. Though far away from China Proper and separated from her by Tibet. Nepal considered China as her suzerain State and up to 1911 Nepal sent annual tribute to China via Tibet. In that year, however, when the Nepal commissioners reached Szechuan and found communications interrupted, they returned to their country. The differential attitude of Nepal toward Great Britain and toward China is due to the difference between the Oriental and Occidental civilization. China has degenerated during the last several hundred years, yet Nepal still respects her as a superior State. Great Britain, on the other hand, is a powerful country, but Nepal has been influenced by Chinese civilization, which, in her eyes, is the true civilization, while that of Britain is nothing but the rule of Might.\n\nNow, what is the problem that underlies Pan-Asianism, the Principle of Greater Asia, which we are discussing here to-day?\n\nBriefly, it is a cultural problem, a problem of comparison and conflict between the Oriental and Occidental culture and civilization. Oriental civilization is the rule of Right; Occidental civilization is the rule of Might. The rule of Right respects benevolence and virtue, while the rule of Might only respects force and utilitarianism. The rule of Right always influences people with justice and reason, while the rule of Might always oppresses people with brute force and military measures. People who are influenced by justice and virtue will never forget their superior State, even if that country has become weak. So Nepal even now willingly respects China as a superior State. People who are oppressed by force never submit entirely to the oppressor State. The relations of Great Britain with Egypt and India form a typical example. Although under British rule, Egypt and India have always entertained the thought of independence and separation from Great Britain. If, Great Britain becomes weaker some day, Egypt and India will overthrow British rule and regain their independence within five years. You should now realize which is the superior civilization, the Oriental or the Occidental?\n\nIf we want to realize Pan-Asianism in this new world, what should be its foundation if not our ancient civilization and culture? Benevolence and virtue must be the foundations of Pan-Asianism. With this as a sound foundation we must then learn science from Europe for our industrial development and the improvement of our armaments, not, however, with a view to oppressing or destroying other countries and peoples as the Europeans have done, but purely for our self-defense.\""

No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self- confidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long.\n\n2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never\u00a0control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the more intelligent will emulate.\n\n3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no\u00a0leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.\n\n4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions,\u00a0shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.\n\n5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan\u00a0his\u00a0work,\u00a0and\u00a0work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks.\n\n6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties\u00a0of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.\n\n7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become\u00a0a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.\n\n8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be\u00a0in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their problems.\n\n9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader's position.\n\n10. WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful\u00a0leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.\n\n11. COOPERATION.

No genuine leader is ever \"too busy\" to do anything which may be required of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he is a leader or follower, admits that he is \"too busy\" to change his plans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his inefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must acquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.\n\n2. UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE.\u00a0Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. \"The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all\" is a truth which all able leaders observe and respect.\n\n3.

The world does not pay men for that which they \"know.\" It pays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.\n\n4.FEAR\u00a0OF\u00a0COMPETITION\u00a0FROM\u00a0FOLLOWERSThe leader who fears that one\u00a0of\u00a0his\u00a0followers may take his position\u00a0is\u00a0practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO PERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid.\n\n5. LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the\u00a0leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his followers efficiently.\n\n6. SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the\u00a0work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.\n\n7. INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an\u00a0intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it.\n\n8. DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head\u00a0of the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the dust of the earth, and brings down on one's head the contempt he deserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life.\n\n9. EMPHASIS OF THE \"AUTHORITY\" OF LEADERSHIP.\u00a0The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instil fear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress his followers with his \"authority\" comes within the category of leadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will have no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct\u2014 his sympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he knows his job.\n\n10. EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no\u00a0\"title\" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes too much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The doors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or ostentation.",

We may believe in free will, but we can hardly be called \u201cfree\u201d if we can\u2019t direct our own attention. No philosopher or cognitive scientist needs to inform us that our behavior isn\u2019t always guided by free will\u2014it becomes obvious as soon as we try to hold our attention on a chosen object\"",
        "\"MEDITATION ON EQUANIMITY\nAfter settling your body in its ground state and attending to your breath for a few moments, bring to mind a person you know well, whose background and living circumstances are familiar to you but who is neither a friend nor an enemy. Attend to this person. This person, like yourself, is striving for happiness and freedom from pain, fear, and insecurity. Focus on this person and shift your awareness to view the world from her eyes. From this point of view, look back on yourself. Regardless of the distinct defects or excellent qualities this person might have, her yearning for happiness and wish to be free from pain and grief are identical to your own. Even though she is not close to the center of your personal universe, her well-being is no less significant than that of a dear loved one whom you may regard as crucial to your happiness.\n\nNow bring to mind a person you feel is crucial to your well-being, a person for whom you have both affection and attachment. Attend closely to this loved one, and shift your awareness to the viewpoint of that person so that you perceive him as a human being like yourself, with both defects and excellent qualities. From this viewpoint, realize that although you are loved by some people, a great number of people feel indifferently toward you, and there also may be some people who don\u2019t like you. This person for whom you feel affection and attachment feels his own desires, hopes, and fears. Now step back and attend to this person from outside. This person is not a true source of your happiness, security, or joy, which can only arise from your own heart and mind.\n\nNext bring to mind a person who may be intent on bringing you harm or depriving you of happiness, a person with whom you feel conflict. As before, imagine stepping into this person\u2019s perspective, being this person from the inside, and experiencing her hopes and fears. Fundamentally, this person, like yourself, wishes to find happiness and freedom from suffering. Now, step back and attend to her from outside with the realization that she is not the source of your distress or anxiety. If you feel uneasy or angry in relationship to this person, the source is in your own heart, not in the other person.\n\nRealize that there is nothing inherent in the stranger, in the loved one, nor in the foe that makes the other person fall into one category or another. Circumstances change, relationships change, and it is the flux of circumstances that gives rise to the thoughts \u201cthis is my enemy\u201d or \u201cthis is my loved one.\u201d Expand the field of awareness to embrace everyone in your immediate environment, their hopes, fears, aspirations, and yearnings. Each person is as important as all others. Shifting circumstances bring us together and also cause us to part. Expand your field of awareness out over the whole community, reaching out in all directions, including everyone. Recognize that each person is fundamentally like yourself, and virtually everyone feels himself to be the center of his world. Imagine the pure depths of your own awareness, unsullied by the obscurations of self-centered attachment and aversion, as an orb of radiant white light at your heart. With each exhalation, let this light spread out evenly in all directions to all persons with the yearning, \u201cMay each one, including myself, find happiness. May everyone, including myself, be free of suffering and the causes of suffering.\u201d Imagine a flood of light going out in all directions, soothing those who are distressed and bringing healing, happiness, and a sense of well-being to everyone. With each in-breath, draw in the distress and causes of unhappiness and pain of each sentient being. Imagine this as a dark cloud that dissolves into the light at your heart, and imagine all beings free of suffering and its causes. Before you bring this session to a close, rest for a moment without bringing anything to mind. Settle your awareness in its own nature, with no object and with no subject. This is the even-mindedness that is a fertile foundation for all spiritual practices.\"",
        "\"With gentle patience, we can gradually train our minds so that they provide us with an inner sense of well-being, instead of constant anxiety, dissatisfaction, and restlessness.\nThis requires compassion for ourselves and for others. The first step is to begin identifying the real causes of our discontent. Virtually anything may catalyze unhappiness, but its true source is always in the mind. Some people feel desperately miserable even when their outer circumstances are wonderful, while others are happy and contented even in the face of dire adversity. We suffer because our minds are afflicted by various kinds of imbalances, which lead us to seek happiness in all the wrong places. But we can emerge from this hedonic treadmill by identifying what truly ails us and what truly brings us satisfaction. Buddhists refer to this shift in priorities as the arousal of a spirit of emergence, with which we move away from the sources of discontent and set out on the path to genuine happiness. This is the most compassionate thing we can do for ourselves.\n\nNone of us lives in isolation, no matter how lonely or alienated we may feel at times. Our welfare is intimately linked to everyone around us, especially those with whom we are in frequent contact. As we learn to be compassionate and nonjudgmental toward ourselves, it is only natural to extend this gentle heart to others. This begins with empathy\u2014feeling with the joys and sorrows, successes and failures of our loved ones, associates, and even strangers. This is the fertile ground from which the seed of compassion sprouts\"",

        "\"The way to counteract laxity is to arouse the attention, to take a greater interest in the object of meditation.\nTibetan contemplatives liken this to stringing a lute. If the strings are too taut, they may easily break under the strain, but if they are too slack, the instrument is unplayable. Likewise, the task at this point is to determine the proper \u201cpitch\u201d of attention. If you arouse the mind too much in your efforts to remedy laxity, it will easily fall into excitation, but if you relax too much, you will likely succumb to laxity. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, and the only way you can meet this challenge is through your own experience, determining for yourself the suitable degree of effort to tune your attention.\"",

A mind settled in such a state of alert equipoise is a fertile ground for the emergence of all kinds of original associations and insights.\n\nMight \u201cgenius\u201d be a potential we all share\u2014each of us with our own unique capacity for creativity, requiring only the power of sustained attention to unlock it? A focused mind can help bring the creative spark to the surface of consciousness. The mind constantly caught up in one distraction after another, on the other hand, may be forever removed from its creative potential. Clearly, if we were to enhance our faculty of attention, our lives would improve dramatically.\"",

Surrender to your body\u2019s need to rest, and use the supine position to calm the mind as well. This likely will be much more refreshing and soothing than watching television or reading a newspaper.\"",
        "\" Even in the midst of work, we can take off fifteen seconds here and sixty seconds there to balance the attention by quietly focusing on the breath.\nOur eyes can be open, and we can sit quietly for a few moments, without calling attention to ourselves. We can do this in the workplace, while standing in line at the grocery store, or while waiting at a stoplight. There are many brief occasions from the time we get up in the morning until we fall asleep at night when we can \u201cseason our day\u201d with a sprinkling of mindfulness of breathing. And each time we do it, we may immediately feel the soothing effect on our bodies and minds. In this way, we can begin to integrate the quality of awareness that we cultivate during meditation with the awareness that we bring to our activities in the world throughout the day.\"",

The Inquisitor claims that the Church, in its mercy, diluted that message, lifting the demand for perfect Being from the shoulders of its followers, providing them instead with the simple and merciful escapes of faith and the afterlife. That work took centuries, says the Inquisitor, and the last thing the Church needs after all that effort is the return of the Man who insisted that people bear all the weight in the first place. Christ listens in silence. Then, as the Inquisitor turns to leave, Christ embraces him, and kisses him on the lips. The Inquisitor turns white, in shock.

The remaining 10 to 15 percent you put in extremely speculative bets, as leveraged as possible (like options), preferably venture capital-style portfolios.* That way you do not depend on errors of risk management; no Black Swan can hurt you at all, beyond your \"floor,\" the nest egg that you have in maximally safe investments. Or, equivalently, you can have a speculative portfolio and insure it (if possible) against losses of more than, say, 15 percent. \n\nYou are \"clipping\" your incomputable risk , the one that is harmful to you. Instead of having medium risk, you have high risk on one side and no risk on the other. The average will be medium risk but constitutes a positive exposure to the Black Swan. More technically, this can be called a \"convex\" combination. \n\nMake sure that you have plenty of these small bets; avoid being blinded by the vividness of one single Black Swan. Have as many of these small bets as you can conceivably have.

        "\"What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn\u2019t\nDeliberate practice is activity designed specifically to improve performance, often with a teacher\u2019s help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results is continuously available; it\u2019s highly demanding mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn\u2019t much fun.\n\nIt\u2019s designed specifically to improve performance.\n\nThe key word in this attribute is designed. e. In some fields, especially intellectual ones such as the arts, science, and business, people may eventually become skilled enough to design their own practice. It\u2019s apparent why becoming significantly good at almost anything is extremely difficult without the help of a teacher or coach, at least in the early going. Without a clear, unbiased view of the subject\u2019s performance, choosing the best practice activity will be impossible; for reasons that may be simply physical (as in sports) or deeply psychological very few of us can make a clear, honest assessment of our own performance. Even if we could, we could not design the best practice activity for that moment in our development\u2014the type of practice that would put us on the road to achieving at the highest levels\u2014unless we had extensive knowledge of the latest and best methods for developing people in our chosen field. Most of us don\u2019t have that knowledge. Deliberate practice requires that one identify certain sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, and then work intently on them. Tiger Woods has been seen to drop golf balls into a sand trap and step on them, then practice shots from that near impossible lie. The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects of what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved; then it\u2019s on to the next aspect. Choosing these aspects of performance is itself an important skill. The point is illustrated by drawing three concentric circles. The inner circle \u201ccomfort zone,\u201d the middle one \u201clearning zone,\u201d and the outer one \u201cpanic zone.\u201d Only by choosing activities in the learning zone can one make progress. That\u2019s the location of skills and abilities that are just out of reach. We can never make progress in the comfort zone because those are the activities we can already do easily, while panic-zone activities are so hard that we don\u2019t even know how to approach them. Identifying the learning zone, which is not simple, and then forcing oneself to stay continually in it as it changes, which is even harder\u2014 these are the first and most important characteristics of deliberate practice.\n\nIt can be repeated a lot.\n\nHigh repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts. Tiger Woods may face that buried lie in the sand only two or three times in a season, and if those were his only opportunities to work on hitting that shot, he certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to hit it very well. Repeating a specific activity over and over is what most of us mean by practice, yet for most of us it isn\u2019t especially effective. Two points distinguish deliberate practice from what most of us actually do. One is the choice of a properly demanding activity in the learning zone, as discussed. The other is the amount of repetition. Top performers repeat their practice activities to stultifying extent. Ted Williams, baseball\u2019s greatest hitter, would practice hitting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at night. More generally, the most effective deliberate practice activities are those that can be repeated at high volume.\n\nFeedback on results is continuously available.\n\nPracticing without feedback is like bowling through a curtain that hangs down to knee level. You can work on technique all you like, but if you can\u2019t see the effects, two things will happen: You won\u2019t get any better, and you\u2019ll stop caring. Getting feedback on most practice activities is easy. Lift the curtain and a bowler knows immediately how he did; in sports generally, seeing the results of practice is no problem. Aspiring chess masters practice by studying chess games played by the greatest players; at each position, the student chooses a move and then gets feedback by seeing what the champion did. Difficulties arise when the results require interpretation. You may believe you played that bar of the Brahms Violin Concerto perfectly, but can you really trust your own judgment? Or you may think that your rehearsal of a job interview was fl awless, but your opinion isn\u2019t what counts. These are situations in which a teacher, coach, or mentor is vital for providing crucial feedback.\n\nIt\u2019s highly demanding mentally.\n\nDeliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it \u201cdeliberate,\u201d as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in. Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are unsatisfactory and then trying one\u2019s hardest to make them better places enormous strains on anyone\u2019s mental abilities. The work is so great that it seems no one can sustain it for very long. A finding that is remarkably consistent across disciplines is that four or five hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no more than an hour to ninety minutes. The best violinists in the Berlin study, for example, practiced about three and a half hours a day, typically in two or three sessions. Many other top-level musicians report four or five hours as their upper limit. Chess champions typically report the same amount of practice. Even elite athletes say the factor that limits their practice time is their ability to sustain concentration. Nathan Milstein, one of the twentieth century\u2019s greatest violinists, was a student of the famous teacher Leopold Auer.\u00a0 As the story goes, Milstein asked Auer if he was practicing enough. Auer responded, \u201cPractice with your fingers and you need all day. Practice with your mind and you will do as much in one and a half hours.\u201d What Auer didn\u2019t add is that it\u2019s a good thing one and a half hours are enough, because if you\u2019re practicing with your mind, you couldn\u2019t possibly keep it up all day.\n\nIt isn\u2019t much fun.\n\nThis follows inescapably from the other characteristics of deliberate practice, which could be described as a recipe for not having fun. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that\u2019s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we\u2019re good at, we insistently seek out what we\u2019re not good at. Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those things over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see\u2014 or get others to tell us\u2014exactly what still isn\u2019t right so we can repeat the most painful and difficult parts of what we\u2019ve just done. We continue that process until we\u2019re mentally exhausted.\n\nIf it seems a bit depressing that the most important thing you can do to improve performance is no fun, take consolation in this fact: It must be so. If the activities that lead to greatness were easy and fun, then everyone would do them and they would not distinguish the best from the rest. The reality that deliberate practice is hard can even be seen as good news. It means that most people won\u2019t do it. So your willingness to do it will distinguish you all the more\"",

        "\"Perhaps most striking, all three groups were spending the same total  amount of time on music-related activities\u2014lessons, practice, classes,  and so on\u2014about fifty-one hours a week.\nAll three groups were getting up every morning and putting in the hours, throwing themselves at their chosen career in a fairly committed way with a demanding workweek equal to what a great many people clock in a wide range of fields. The violinists were quite certain which activity was most important for making them better: It was practicing by themselves. When asked to rate the relevance of twelve music-related activities to their progress, solitary practice was number one with a bullet. They all knew it, but they didn\u2019t all do it. The amount of time the various groups actually spent practicing alone differed dramatically. The two top groups, the best and better violinists, practiced by themselves about twenty-four hours a week on average. The third group, the good violinists, practiced by themselves only nine hours a week.\n\nJust as the violinists were sure that it\u2019s the most important activity, they were also quite clear that it\u2019s hard and it isn\u2019t much fun. When they rated activities by effort required, solo practice ranked way harder than playing music for fun, alone or with others, and harder than even the most effortful everyday activity, child care. As for pleasure, practice ranked far below playing for fun and even below formal group performance, which you might reasonably guess would be the most stressful and least fun activity.\n\nPractice is so hard that doing a lot of it requires people to arrange their lives in particular ways. The two top groups of violinists did most of their practicing in the late morning or early afternoon, when they were still fairly fresh. By contrast, violinists in the third group practiced mostly in the late afternoon, when they were more likely to be tired. The two top groups differed from the third group in another way: They slept more. They not only slept more at night, they also took far more afternoon naps. All that practicing seems to demand a lot of recovery.\n\nSo all the violinists understood that practicing by themselves was the most important thing they could do to get better. Though they didn\u2019t consider it easy or fun. The difference was that some chose to practice more, and those violinists were a great deal better.\"",

They will never achieve what they might have.\n\nWhat you really believe about the source of great performance thus becomes the foundation of all you will ever achieve. As we noted much earlier, such beliefs can be extremely deep-seated. Regardless of where our beliefs in this matter originated, however, we all have the opportunity to base them on the evidence of reality.\n\nThe evidence offers no easy assurances. It shows that the price of top-level achievement is extraordinarily high. Perhaps it\u2019s inevitable that not many people will choose to pay it.

        "\"While it\u2019s clear that extensive deliberate practice will make someone a  superior surgeon or billiard player or public speaker, it\u2019s natural to wonder if the effect can be understood in some general way.\nBeyond simply making a person better at the specific task they\u2019re practicing, is it doing something that applies across cases? The answer is yes, and it\u2019s worth identifying because it\u2019s the opposite of what most people think. If you\u2019re a golf fan, you may have seen videotape of Tiger Woods in a particular situation that has occurred a few times in his career. He\u2019s in a tournament, standing over the ball, about to hit his shot. At some moment after he has begun his swing but before he has hit the ball, a major distraction happens\u2014a fan yells, someone moves sharply, the crowd roars elsewhere on the course. Woods stops himself in mid-swing, steps back from the ball, recomposes himself, and then steps forward and hits the shot. Ordinary golfers respond with awe when they see this happen because they know what they\u2019d do in the same circumstance: Unable to stop their swing once they\u2019d started it, they would carry through and hit a terrible shot or maybe miss the ball completely. Why is this significant? Frequently when we see great performers doing what they do, it strikes us that they\u2019ve practiced for so long, and done it so many times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, what they have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically. When we learn to do anything new\u2014how to drive, for example\u2014we go through three stages. The first stage demands a lot of attention as we try out the controls, learn the rules of driving, and so on. In the second stage we begin to coordinate our knowledge, linking movements together and more fluidly combining our actions with our knowledge of the car, the situation, and the rules. In the third stage we drive the car with barely a thought. It\u2019s automatic. And with that our improvement at driving slows dramatically, eventually stopping completely. For most of the things we do, including driving, that\u2019s not a problem. We don\u2019t need to be great at such things, just good enough to carry on with our lives. That category of activities includes golf for most people who play the game. They don\u2019t need to earn a living at it; they just want to be able to have fun with it. Not having to devote much thought to such activities is a blessing, since it frees our minds to focus on other matters that we consider more important. But it does mean that our brains have pretty much checked out when we\u2019re doing these things. By contrast, great performers never allow themselves to reach the automatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen fi eld. That is the effect of continual deliberate practice\u2014avoiding automaticity. The essence of practice, which is constantly trying to do the things one cannot do comfortably, makes automatic behavior impossible. It\u2019s certainly true that a great performer is able to do many things in his or her fi eld with far fewer mental demands than a novice performer; an excellent pilot lands a 747 without breaking a sweat.\n\nBut ultimately the performance is always conscious and controlled, not automatic. Avoiding automaticity through continual practice is another way of saying that great performers are always getting better. This is why the most devoted can stay at the top of their field for far longer than most people would think possible.\"",

        "\"Unresolved conflicts.\nColonel Stas Preczewski, coach of the army crew team at West Point a few years ago, faced a baffling problem. Through extensive testing he had determined the strengths and abilities of every rower on his team. He had measured each man\u2019s power on ergometers and had composed crews in every possible combination in order to calculate each member\u2019s contribution. He was able to rank his rowers objectively and precisely from best to worst. He then put the eight best in his varsity boat and the eight others, the weakest, in the junior varsity boat.\n\nThe problem: The JV boat beat the varsity boat two-thirds of the time. The situation is explained in a famous Harvard Business School case, which also notes that the varsity boat was full of resentment over who was contributing most, while the JV rowers, feeling they had nothing to lose, supported one another happily. But the case doesn\u2019t tell how Coach Preczewski solved his problem. One day he lined up the varsity crew in four pairs. He told them they were to wrestle for ninety seconds. Only rule: no punching. \u201cIt was like the WWF,\u201d he recalls. When he stopped them, he noticed that no one was winning. Each man was discovering that his opponent was just as strong and determined as he was. Preczewski then had them change opponents and wrestle again. By the third round they were choosing their own opponents\u2014\u201cOne guy would point at another and say,\u2018You!\u2019\u201d Preczewski says. On the fourth or fifth round, one of the rowers started laughing, and they all piled into a general brawl. Eventually someone said, \u201cCoach, can we go row now?\u201d From then on the varsity boat fl ew, and made it to the semifinals in the national tournament. You probably can\u2019t order members of an executive team to wrestle, tempting though it may be. But there are other ways to discharge tensions that are crippling a group.

Doing it is an important element of dealing with a more general threat to team performance. . . . Unwillingness to face the real issues. The usual metaphor is the elephant in the room. Former Eli Lilly CEO Randall Tobias called it the moose on the table. George Kohlrieser, a professor at the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland, has developed the metaphor particularly well: \u201cPut the fish on the table,\u201d he says.

And what we have discovered so far is not what makes  some people excel but rather what doesn\u2019t. Specifically:\n\u2022 It isn\u2019t experience. Not only are we surrounded by highly experienced people who are nowhere near great at what they do, but we have also seen evidence that some people in a wide range of fi elds actually get worse after years of doing something.\n\n\u2022 It isn\u2019t specific inborn abilities. We\u2019ve seen extensive evidence that calls into question whether such abilities exist, and even if certain types of them might, they clearly do not determine excellence.People who seem to possess abilities of this type do not necessarily achieve high performance, and we\u2019ve seen many examples of people showing no evidence of such abilities who have produced extraordinary achievement.\n\n\u2022 It isn\u2019t general abilities such as intelligence and memory. The research finds that in many fields the relation between intelligence and performance is weak or nonexistent; people with modest IQs sometimes perform outstandingly while people with high IQs sometimes don\u2019t get past mediocrity.

        "\"To put the results in their starkest terms:\nShown five groups of students, one of which won positions at a top-ranked music school and one of which gave up even trying to play an instrument, we would all say the first group is obviously immensely more talented than the latter. But the study showed that\u2014at least as most of us understand \u201ctalent,\u201d meaning an ability to achieve more easily\u2014they were not.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers studied the results of those nationally administered grade-level exams. You would expect, of course, that the students who went on to win places at the music school\u2014and this was a school whose graduates regularly win national competitions and go on to professional music careers\u2014would reach any given grade level more quickly and easily than the students who ended up being less accomplished. That\u2019s the very meaning of being musically talented. But it didn\u2019t happen. On the contrary: The researchers calculated the average hours of practice needed by the most elite group of students to reach each grade level, and they calculated the average hours needed by each of the other groups. There were no statistically significant differences. For students who ended up going to the elite music school as well as for students who just played casually for fun, it took an average of twelve hundred hours of practice to reach grade 5, for example. The music school students reached grade levels at earlier ages than the other students for the simple reason that they practiced more each day. By age twelve, the researchers found, the students in the most elite group were practicing an average of two hours a day versus about fifteen minutes a day for the students in the lowest group, an 800 pecent difference. So students could put in their hours a little bit each day or a lot each day, but nothing, it turned out, enabled any group to reach any given grade level without putting in those hours. As one of the researchers, Professor John A. Sloboda of the University of Keele, put it: \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence of a \u2018fast track\u2019 for high achievers.\u201d \""

Are they even worth pursuing? I\u2019ve long held on to a clipping from a newspaper in Roanoke, Virginia. It featured a photo of a pregnant woman who had lodged a protest against a local construction site. She worried that the sound of jackhammers was injuring her unborn child. But get this: In the photo, the woman is holding a cigarette. If she cared about her unborn child, the time she spent railing against jackhammers would have been better spent putting out that cigarette.\n\n Develop a good filing system. \nWhen I told Jai I wanted to have a place in the house where we could file everything in alphabetical order, she said I sounded way too compulsive for her tastes.

        "\"When to Sell And When Not To\nThere are many good reasons why an investor might decide to sell\ncommon stocks. He may want to build a new home or finance his son in\na business. Any one of a number of similar reasons can, from the\nstandpoint of happy living, make selling common stocks sensible. This\ntype of selling, however, is personal rather than financial in its motive.\nAs such it is well beyond the scope of this book. These com-ments are\nonly designed to cover that type of selling that is motivated by a single\nobjective\u2014obtaining the greatest total dollar benefit from the investment\ndollars available.\nI believe there are three reasons, and three reasons only, for the sale of\nany common stock which has been originally selected according to the\ninvestment principles already discussed. The first of these reasons should\nbe obvious to anyone. This is when a mistake has been made in the\noriginal purchase and it becomes increasingly clear that the fac-tual\nbackground of the particular company is, by a significant margin, less\nfavorable than originally believed. The proper handling of this type of\nsituation is largely a matter of emotional self-control. To some degree it\nalso depends upon the investor's ability to be honest with himself.\nTwo of the important characteristics of common stock investment are the\nlarge profits that can come with proper handling, and the high degree of\nskill, knowledge, and judgment required for such proper han-dling. Since\nthe process of obtaining these almost fantastic profits is so complex, it is\nnot surprising that a certain percentage of errors in purchasing are sure to\noccur. Fortunately the long-range profits from really good common\nstocks should more than balance the losses from a nor-mal percentage of\nsuch mistakes. They should leave a tremendous mar-gin of gain as well.\nThis is particularly true if the mistake is recognized quickly. When this\nhappens, losses, if any, should be far smaller than if the stock bought in\nerror had been held for a long period of time. Even more important, the\nfunds tied up in the undesirable situation are freed to be used for\nsomething else which, if properly selected, should produce substantial\ngains.\nHowever, there is a complicating factor that makes the handling of\ninvestment mistakes more difficult. This is the ego in each of us. None of\nus likes to admit to himself that he has been wrong. If we have made a\nmistake in buying a stock but can sell the stock at a small profit, we have\nsomehow lost any sense of having been foolish. On the other hand, if we\nsell at a small loss we are quite unhappy about the whole matter. This\nreaction, while completely natural and normal, is probably one of the\nmost dangerous in which we can indulge ourselves in the entire\ninvestment process. More money has probably been lost by investors\nholding a stock they really did not want until they could \u201cat least come\nout even\u201d than from any other single reason. If to these actual losses are\nadded the profits that might have been made through the proper\nreinvestment of these funds if such reinvestment had been made when\nthe mistake was first realized, the cost of self-indulgence becomes truly\ntremendous.\nFurthermore this dislike of taking a loss, even a small loss, is just as\nillogical as it is natural. If the real object of common stock investment is\nthe making of a gain of a great many hundreds per cent over a period of\nyears, the difference between, say, a 20 per cent loss or a 5 per cent profit\nbecomes a comparatively insignificant matter. What matters is not\nwhether a loss occasionally occurs. What does matter is whether worth\u0002while profits so often fail to materialize that the skill of the investor or\nhis advisor in handling investments must be questioned.\nWhile losses should never cause strong self-disgust or emotional upset,\nneither should they be passed over lightly. They should always be\nreviewed with care so that a lesson is learned from each of them. If the\nparticular elements which caused a misjudgment on a common stock\npurchase are thoroughly understood, it is unlikely that another poor\npurchase will be made through misjudging the same investment factors.\nWe come now to the second reason why sale should be made of a\ncommon stock purchased under the investment principles already out\u0002lined in Chapters Two and Three. Sales should always be made of the\nstock of a company which, because of changes resulting from the pas\u0002sage of time, no longer qualifies in regard to the fifteen points outlined in\nChapter Three to about the same degree it qualified at the time of\npurchase. This is why investors should be constantly on their guard. It\nexplains why it is of such importance to keep at all times in close contact\nwith the affairs of companies whose shares are held.\nWhen companies deteriorate in this way they usually do so for one of\ntwo reasons. Either there has been a deterioration of management, or the\ncompany no longer has the prospect of increasing the markets for its\nproduct in the way it formerly did. Sometimes management deteri-orates\nbecause success has affected one or more key executives. Smug-ness,\ncomplacency, or inertia replace the former drive and ingenuity. More\noften it occurs because a new set of top executives do not meas-ure up to\nthe standard of performance set by their predecessors. Either they no\nlonger hold to the policies that have made the company outstandingly\nsuccessful, or they do not have the ability to continue to carry out such\npolicies. When any of these things happen the affected stock should be\nsold at once, regardless of how good the general market may look or how\nbig the capital gains tax may be.\nSimilarly it sometimes happens that after growing spectacularly for\nmany years, a company will reach a stage where the growth prospects of\nits markets are exhausted. From this time on it will only do about as well\nas industry as a whole. It will only progress at about the same rate as the\nnational economy does. This change may not be due to any deterioration\nof the management. Many managements show great skill in developing\nrelated or allied products to take advantage of growth in their immediate\nfield. They recognize, however, that they do not have any particular\nadvantage if they go into unrelated spheres of activity. Hence, if after\nyears of being experts in a young and growing industry, times change\nand the company has pretty well exhausted the growth prospects of its\nmarket, its shares have deteriorated in an important way from the\nstandards outlined under our frequently mentioned fifteen points. Such a\nstock should then be sold.\nIn this instance, selling might take place at a more leisurely pace than if\nmanagement deterioration had set in. Possibly part of the holding might\nbe kept until a more suitable investment could be found. However, in any\nevent, the company should be recognized as no longer suitable for worth\u0002while investment. The amount of capital gains tax, no matter how large,\nshould seldom prevent the switching of such funds into some other situ\u0002ation which, in the years ahead, may grow in a manner similar to the way\nin which this investment formerly grew.\nThere is a good test as to whether companies no longer adequately\nqualify in regard to this matter of expected further growth. This is for the\ninvestor to ask himself whether at the next peak of a business cycle,\nregardless of what may happen in the meantime, the comparative per-\nshare earnings (after allowances for stock dividends and stock splits but\nnot for new shares issued for additional capital) will probably show at\nleast as great an increase from present levels as the present levels show\nfrom the last known peak of general business activity. If the answer is in\nthe affirmative, the stock probably should be held. If in the negative, it\nshould probably be sold.\nFor those who follow the right principles in making their original\npurchases, the third reason why a stock might be sold seldom arises, and\nshould be acted upon only if an investor is very sure of his ground. It\narises from the fact that opportunities for attractive investment are\nextremely hard to find. From a timing standpoint, they are seldom found\njust when investment funds happen to be available. If an investor has had\nfunds for investment for quite a period of time and found few attractive\nsituations into which to place these funds, he may well place some or all\nof them in a well-run company which he believes has def-inite growth\nprospects. However, these growth prospects may be at a slower average\nannual rate than may appear to be the case for some other seemingly\nmore attractive situation that is found later. The already-owned company\nmay in some other important aspects appear to be less attractive as well.\nIf the evidence is clear-cut and the investor feels quite sure of his ground,\nit will, even after paying capital gains taxes, probably pay him\nhandsomely to switch into the situation with seemingly better prospects.\nThe company that can show an average annual increase of 12 per cent\nfor a long period of years should be a source of considerable financial\nsatisfaction to its owners. However, the difference between these results\nand those that could occur from a company showing a 20 per cent\naverage annual gain would be well worth the additional trouble and\ncapital gains taxes that might be involved.\nA word of caution may not be amiss, however, in regard to too read-ily\nselling a common stock in the hope of switching these funds into a still\nbetter one. There is always the risk that some major element in the\npicture has been misjudged. If this happens, the investment probably will\nnot turn out nearly as well as anticipated. In contrast, an alert investor\nwho has held a good stock for some time usually gets to know its less\ndesirable as well as its more desirable characteristics. Therefore, before\nselling a rather satisfactory holding in order to get a still better one, there\nis need of the greatest care in trying to appraise accurately all elements\nof the situation.\nAt this point the critical reader has probably discerned a basic investment\nprinciple which by and large seems only to be understood by a small\nminority of successful investors. This is that once a stock has been\nproperly selected and has borne the test of time, it is only occasionally\nthat there is any reason for selling it at all. However, recommendations\nand comments continue to pour out of the financial community giving\nother types of reasons for selling outstanding common stocks. What\nabout the validity of such reasons?\nMost frequently given of such reasons is the conviction that a gen-eral\nstock market decline of some proportion is somewhere in the offing. In\nthe preceding chapter I tried to show that postponing an attrac-tive\npurchase because of fear of what the general market might do will, over\nthe years, prove very costly. This is because the investor is ignoring a\npowerful influence about which he has positive knowledge through fear\nof a less powerful force about which, in the present state of human\nknowledge, he and everyone else is largely guessing. If the argument is\nvalid that the purchase of attractive common stocks should not be unduly\ninfluenced by fear of ordinary bear markets, the argument against selling\noutstanding stocks because of these fears is even more impressive. All\nthe arguments mentioned in the previous chapter equally apply here.\nFurthermore, the chance of the investor being right in making such sales\nis still further diminished by the factor of the capital gains tax. Because\nof the very large profits such outstanding stocks should be showing if\nthey have been held for a period of years, this cap-ital gains tax can still\nfurther accentuate the cost of making such sales.\nThere is another and even more costly reason why an investor should\nnever sell out of an outstanding situation because of the possibility that\nan ordinary bear market may be about to occur. If the com-pany is really\na right one, the next bull market should see the stock mak-ing a new\npeak well above those so far attained. How is the investor to know when\nto buy back? Theoretically it should be after the coming decline.\nHowever, this presupposes that the investor will know when the decline\nwill end. I have seen many investors dispose of a holding that was to\nshow stupendous gain in the years ahead because of this fear of a coming\nbear market. Frequently the bear market never came and the stock went\nright on up. When a bear market has come, I have not seen one time in\nten when the investor actually got back into the same shares before they\nhad gone up above his selling price. Usually he either waited for them to\ngo far lower than they actually dropped, or, when they were way down,\nfear of something else happening still prevented their reinstatement.\nThis brings us to another line of reasoning so often used to cause well\u0002intentioned but unsophisticated investors to miss huge future prof-its.\nThis is the argument that an outstanding stock has become over-priced\nand therefore should be sold. What is more logical than this? If a stock is\noverpriced, why not sell it rather than keep it?\nBefore reaching hasty conclusions, let us look a little bit below the\nsurface. Just what is overpriced? What are we trying to accomplish? Any\nreally good stock will sell and should sell at a higher ratio to current\nearnings than a stock with a stable rather than an expanding earning\npower. After all, this probability of participating in continued growth is\nobviously worth something. When we say that the stock is overpriced,\nwe may mean that it is selling at an even higher ratio in relation to this\nexpected earning power than we believe it should be. Possibly we may\nmean that it is selling at an even higher ratio than are other comparable\nstocks with similar prospects of materially increasing their future\nearnings.\nAll of this is trying to measure something with a greater degree of\npreciseness than is possible. The investor cannot pinpoint just how much\nper share a particular company will earn two years from now. He can at\nbest judge this within such general and non-mathematical limits as\n\u201cabout the same,\u201d \u201cup moderately,\u201d \u201cup a lot,\u201d or \u201cup tremendously.\u201d As\na matter of fact, the company's top management cannot come a great deal\ncloser than this. Either they or the investor should come pretty close in\njudging whether a sizable increase in average earnings is likely to occur\na few years from now. But just how much increase, or the exact year in\nwhich it will occur, usually involves guessing on enough vari-ables to\nmake precise predictions impossible.\nUnder these circumstances, how can anyone say with even moderate\nprecision just what is overpriced for an outstanding company with an\nunusually rapid growth rate? Suppose that instead of selling at\ntwentyfive times earnings, as usually happens, the stock is now at thirty\u0002five times earnings. Perhaps there are new products in the immediate\nfuture, the real economic importance of which the financial community\nhas not yet grasped. Perhaps there are not any such products. If the\ngrowth rate is so good that in another ten years the company might well\nhave quadrupled, is it really of such great concern whether at the\nmoment the stock might or might not be 35 per cent overpriced? That\nwhich really matters is not to disturb a position that is going to be worth\na great deal more later.\nAgain our old friend the capital gains tax adds its bit to these\nconclusions. Growth stocks which are recommended for sale because\nthey are supposedly overpriced nearly always will cost their owners a\nsizable cap-ital gains tax if they are sold. Therefore, in addition to the\nrisk of losing a permanent position in a company which over the years\nshould continue to show unusual further gains, we also incur a sizable\ntax liability. Isn't it safer and cheaper simply to make up our minds that\nmomentarily the stock may be somewhat ahead of itself? We already\nhave a sizable profit in it. If for a while the stock loses, say, 35 per cent\nof its current market quotation, is this really such a serious matter?\nAgain, isn't the maintaining of our position rather than the possibility of\ntemporarily losing a small part of our capital gain the matter which is\nreally important?\nThere is still one other argument investors sometimes use to sepa-rate\nthemselves from the profits they would otherwise make. This one is the\nmost ridiculous of all. It is that the stock they own has had a huge\nadvance. Therefore, just because it has gone up, it has probably used up\nmost of its potential. Consequently they should sell it and buy some\u0002thing that hasn't gone up yet. Outstanding companies, the only type\nwhich I believe the investor should buy, just don't function this way.\nHow they do function might best be understood by considering the\nfollowing somewhat fanciful analogy:\nSuppose it is the day you graduated from college. If you did not go to\ncollege, consider it to be the day of your high school graduation; from\nthe standpoint of our example it will make no difference whatsoever.\nNow suppose that on this day each of your male classmates had an\nurgent need of immediate cash. Each offered you the same deal. If you\nwould give them a sum of money equivalent to ten times whatever they\nmight earn during the first twelve months after they had gone to work,\nthat classmate would for the balance of his life turn over to you one\nquarter of each year's earnings! Finally let us suppose that, while you\nthought this was an excellent proposition, you only had spare cash on\nhand sufficient to make such a deal with three of your classmates.\nAt this point, your reasoning would closely resemble that of the investor\nusing sound investment principles in selecting common stocks. You\nwould immediately start analyzing your classmates, not from the\nstandpoint of how pleasant they might be or even how talented they\nmight be in other ways, but solely to determine how much money they\nmight make. If you were part of a large class, you would probably\neliminate quite a number solely on the ground of not knowing them\nsuffi-ciently well to be able to pass worthwhile judgment on just how\nfinan-cially proficient they actually would get to be. Here again, the\nanalogy with intelligent common stock buying runs very close.\nEventually you would pick the three classmates you felt would have the\ngreatest future earning power. You would make your deal with them. Ten\nyears have passed. One of your three has done sensationally. Going to\nwork for a large corporation, he has won promotion after promotion.\nAlready insiders in the company are saying that the president has his eye\non him and that in another ten years he will probably take the top job. He\nwill be in line for the large compensation, stock options, and pension\nbenefits that go with that job.\nUnder these circumstances, what would even the writers of stock market\nreports who urge taking profits on superb stocks that \u201chave gotten ahead\nof the market\u201dthink of your selling out your contract with this former\nclassmate, just because someone has offered you 600 per cent on your\noriginal investment? You would think that anyone would need to have\nhis head examined if he were to advise you to sell this contract and\nreplace it with one with another former classmate whose annual earnings\nstill were about the same as when he left school ten years before. The\nargument that your successful classmate had had his advance while the\nadvance of your (financially) unsuccessful classmate still lay ahead of\nhim would probably sound rather silly. If you know your common stocks\nequally well, many of the arguments commonly heard for selling the\ngood one sound equally silly.\nYou may be thinking all this sounds fine, but actually classmates are not\ncommon stocks. To be sure, there is one major difference. That\ndifference increases rather than decreases the reason for never selling the\noutstanding common stock just because it has had a huge rise and may\nbe temporarily overpriced. This difference is that the classmate is finite,\nmay die soon and is sure to die eventually. There is no similar life span\nfor the common stock. The company behind the common stock can have\na practice of selecting management talent in depth and training such\ntalent in company policies, methods, and techniques in a way which will\nretain and pass on the corporate vigor for generations. Look at Du Pont\nin its second century of corporate existence. Look at Dow years after the\ndeath of its brilliant founder. In this era of unlimited human wants and\nincredible markets, there is no limitation to corporate growth such as the\nlife span places upon the individual.\nPerhaps the thoughts behind this chapter might be put into a single\nsentence: If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is\npurchased, the time to sell it is\u2014almost never.\"",
        "\"Instead of saying they have nothing to do with the case, we might say they have very little to do with it.\nForemost among such statistics are the price ranges at which a stock has\nsold in former years. For some reason, the first thing many investors\nwant to see when they are considering buying a particular stock is a table\ngiving the highest and lowest price at which that stock has sold in each\nof the past five or ten years. They go through a sort of mental mumbo-jumbo, and come up with a nice round figure which is the price they are\nwilling to pay for the particular stock.\n\nIs this illogical? Is it financially dangerous? The answer to both\nquestions is emphatically yes. It is dangerous because it puts the emphasis on what does not particularly matter, and diverts attention from what does matter. This frequently causes investors to pass up a situation in which they would make big profits in order to go into one where the\nprofits will be much smaller. To understand this we must see why the\nmental process is so illogical.\n\nWhat makes the price at which a stock sells? It is the composite estimate\nat that moment of what all those interested think the corrective value of\nsuch shares may be. It is the composite appraisal of the outlook for this\ncompany by all potential buyers and sellers, weighted by the number of\nshares each buyer or seller is disposed to bid for or offer, in relation to a\nsimilar appraisal, at the same moment, of the outlook for other\ncompanies with their individual prospects. Occasionally, some-thing like\nforced liquidation will produce a moderate deviation from this figure.\nThis happens when a large holder presses stock on the mar-ket for\nreasons\u2014such as liquidating an estate or paying off a loan\u2014 which may\nnot be directly related to the seller's view of the real value of the shares.\nHowever, such pressures usually cause only moderate vari-ation from the\ncomposite appraisal of the prevailing price of the shares, since bargain\nhunters normally step in to take advantage of the situation, which thereby\nadjusts itself.\n\nThe point which is of real significance is that the price is based on the\ncurrent appraisal of the situation. As changes in the affairs of the company become known, these appraisals become correspondingly more or less favorable. In relation to other stocks, these particular shares then\nmove up or down. If the factors appraised were judged correctly, the\nstock becomes permanently more or less valuable in relation to other\nstocks. The shares then stay up or down. If more of these same factors\ncontinue to develop, they in turn are recognized by the financial\ncommunity. The stock then goes and stays either further up or down, as\nthe case may be.\n\nTherefore, the price at which the stock sold four years ago may have\nlittle or no real relationship to the price at which it sells today. The\ncompany may have developed a host of able new executives, a series of\nnew and highly profitable products, or any number of similar desirable\nattributes that make the stock intrinsically worth four times as much in\nrelation to the price of other stocks as it was worth four years ago. The\ncompany might have fallen into the hands of an inefficient management\nand slipped so badly in relation to competition that the only way recovery could occur would be through the raising of much new capital. This might force such a dilution of the shares that the stock today could not\npossibly be worth more than a quarter of the price of four years ago.\nAgainst this background, it can be seen why investors so frequently pass\nup stocks which would have brought them huge future gains, for ones\nwhere the gain is very much smaller. By giving heavy emphasis to the\n\u201cstock that hasn't gone up yet\u201d they are unconsciously subscribing to the\ndelusion that all stocks go up about the same amount and that the one\nthat has already risen a lot will not climb further, while the one that has\nnot yet gone up has something \u201cdue\u201d it. Nothing could be further from\nthe truth. The fact that a stock has or has not risen in the last several\nyears is of no significance whatsoever in determining whether it should\nbe bought now. What does matter is whether enough improvement has\ntaken place or is likely to take place in the future to justify importantly\nhigher prices than those now prevailing. Similarly, many investors will give heavy weight to the per-share earnings of the past five years in trying to decide whether a stock should be bought. To look at the per-share earnings by themselves and give the earnings of four or five years ago any significance is like trying to get useful work from an engine which is unconnected to any device to which that engine's power is supposed to be applied. Just knowing, by itself, that four or five years ago a company's per-share earnings were either four times or a quarter of this year's earnings has almost no significance in indicating whether a particular stock should be bought or sold. Again, what counts is knowledge of background conditions. An understanding of what probably will happen over the next several years is of overriding importance.\n\nThe investor is constantly being fed a diet of reports and so-called\nanalyses largely centered around these price figures for the past five\nyears. He should keep in mind that it is the next five years' earnings, not\nthose of the past five years, that now matter to him.\n\nThey emphasize these past earnings records in a sincere belief that\ndetailed accounting descriptions of what happened last year will give a\ntrue picture of what will happen next year. This may be true for certain\nclasses of regulated companies such as public utilities. For the type of\nenterprise which I believe should interest an investor desiring the best\nresults for his money, it can be completely false.\"",

If you\u2019re not quite there, ask the killer question: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t already own this, how much would I spend to buy it?\u201d This usually does the trick. In other words, it\u2019s not enough to simply determine which activities and efforts don\u2019t make the highest possible contribution; you still have to actively eliminate those that do not. Part Two of this book will show you how to eliminate the non-essentials, and not only that, how do it in a way that garners you respect from colleagues, bosses, clients, and peers.\n\n3. EXECUTE If you want your closet to stay tidy, you need a regular routine for organizing it. You need one large bag for items you need to throw away and a very small pile for items you want to keep. You need to know the dropoff location and hours of your local thrift store. You need to have a scheduled time to go there. In other words, once you\u2019ve figured out which activities and efforts to keep\u2014the ones that make your highest level of contribution\u2014you need a system to make executing your intentions as effortless as possible.\"",

        "\"Why are adults so much more vulnerable to the sunk-cost bias than young children?\nThe answer, he believes, is a lifetime of exposure to the \u201cDon\u2019t waste\u201d rule, so that by the time we are adults we are trained to avoid appearing wasteful, even to ourselves.8 \u201cAbandoning a project that you\u2019ve invested a lot in feels like you\u2019ve wasted everything, and waste is something we\u2019re told to avoid,\u201d Arkes said.

Several weeks later you buy a $50 ticket for a weekend ski trip to Wisconsin. You think you will enjoy the Wisconsin ski trip more than the Michigan ski trip. As you are putting your newly purchased Wisconsin ticket in your wallet you notice that the Michigan ski trip and the Wisconsin ski trip are for the same weekend. It\u2019s too late to sell or return either ticket. You must choose which to use.\u201d When asked, \u201cWhich ski trip will you go on?\u201d more than half said they would opt for the more expensive trip, even though they would enjoy it less.

I replied: \u201cI am consumed with writing my book right now :) But I would love to get together once the book is finished. Let me know if we can get together towards the end of the summer.\u201d E-mail is also a good way to start practicing saying \u201cno but\u201d because it gives you the chance to draft and redraft your \u201cno\u201d to make it as graceful as possible.

It enabled her to take back control of her own decisions rather than be rushed into a \u201cyes\u201d when she was asked.\n\n4\\. Use e-mail bouncebacks. It is totally natural and expected to get an autoresponse when someone is traveling or out of the office.\u00a0Really, this is the most socially acceptable \u201cno\u201d there is. People aren\u2019t saying they don\u2019t want to reply to your e-mail, they\u2019re just saying they can\u2019t get back to you for a period of time. So why limit these to vacations and holidays?

Unfortunately, I am unable to respond in the manner I would like. For this, I apologize. \u2014Greg.\u201d And guess what? People seemed to adapt to my temporary absence and nonresponsiveness just fine.\n\n5\\. Say, \u201cYes. What should I deprioritize?\u201d Saying no to a senior leader at work is almost unthinkable, even laughable, for many people. However, when saying yes is going to compromise your ability to make the highest level of contribution to your work, it is also your obligation. In this case it is not only reasonable to say no, it is essential. One effective\u00a0way to do that is to remind your superiors what you would be neglecting if you said yes and force them to grapple with the trade-off.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if your manager comes to you and asks you to do X, you can respond with \u201cYes, I\u2019m happy to make this the priority. Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?\u201d Or simply say, \u201cI would want to do a great job, and given my other commitments I wouldn\u2019t be able to do a job I was proud of if I took this on.\u201d I know a leader who received this response from a subordinate. There was no way he wanted to be responsible for disrupting this productive and organized employee, so he took the nonessential work project back and gave it to someone else who was less organized!\n\n6\\. Say it with humor. I recently was asked by a friend to join him in training for a marathon. My response was simple: \u201cNope!\u201d He laughed a little and said, \u201cAh, you practice what you preach.\u201d Just goes to show how useful it is to have a reputation as an Essentialist!\u00a0\n\n7\\.

I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you.\u201d By this you are also saying, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to drive you.\u201d You are saying what you will not do, but you are couching it in terms of what you are willing to do. This is a particularly good way to navigate a request you would like to support somewhat but cannot throw your full weight behind.\u00a0I particularly like this construct because it also expresses a respect for the other person\u2019s ability to choose, as well as your own. It reminds both parties of the choices they have.\n\n8\\. \u201cI can\u2019t do it, but X might be interested.\u201d It is tempting to think that our help is uniquely invaluable, but often people requesting something don\u2019t really care if we\u2019re the ones who help them\u2014as long as they get the help. \"",

        "\"So how do we learn to say no gracefully? Below are general guidelines followed by a number of specific scripts for delivering the graceful \"no.\"\nSEPARATE THE DECISION FROM THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nWhen people ask us to do something, we can confuse the request with our relationship with them. Sometimes they seem so interconnected, we forget that denying the request is not the same as denying the person. Only once we separate the decision from the relationship can we make a clear decision and then separately find\u00a0the courage and compassion to communicate it.\n\nSAYING \u201cNO\u201d GRACEFULLY DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO MEAN USING THE WORD NO\n\nEssentialists choose \u201cno\u201d more often than they say no. There may be a time when the most graceful way to say no is to simply say a blunt no. But whether it\u2019s \u201cI am flattered that you thought of me but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the bandwidth\u201d or \u201cI would very much like to but I\u2019m overcommitted,\u201d there are a variety of ways of refusing someone clearly and politely without actually using the word no.\n\nFOCUS ON THE TRADE-OFF\n\nThe more we think about what we are giving up when we say yes to someone, the easier it is to say no. If we have no clear sense of the opportunity cost\u2014in other words, the value of what we are giving up\u2014then it is especially easy to fall into the nonessential trap of telling ourselves we can get it all done. We can\u2019t. A graceful \u201cno\u201d grows out of a clear but unstated calculation of the trade-off.\n\nREMIND YOURSELF THAT EVERYONE IS SELLING SOMETHING\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you have to be cynical about people. I don\u2019t mean to imply people shouldn\u2019t be trusted. I am simply saying everyone is selling something\u2014an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion\u2014in exchange for your time. Simply being aware of what is being sold allows us to be more deliberate in deciding whether we want to buy it.\n\nMAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE FACT THAT SAYING \u201cNO\u201d OFTEN REQUIRES TRADING POPULARITY FOR RESPECT\n\nWhen you say no, there is usually a short-term impact on the relationship. After all, when someone asks for something and doesn\u2019t get it, his or her immediate reaction may be annoyance or disappointment or even anger. This downside is clear. The potential upside, however, is less obvious: when the initial annoyance or disappointment or anger wears off,\u00a0the respect kicks in. When we push back effectively,\u00a0it shows people that our time is highly valuable. It distinguishes the professional from the amateur.\n\nA case in point is the time the graphic designer Paul Rand had the guts to say no to Steve Jobs. When Jobs was looking for a logo for the company NeXT, he asked Rand, whose work included the logos for IBM, UPS, Enron, Westinghouse, and ABC, to come up with a few options. But Rand didn\u2019t want to come up with \u201ca few options.\u201d He wanted to design just one option. So Rand said: \u201cNo. I will solve your problem for you. And you will pay me. And you don\u2019t have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people. But I will solve the problem the best way I know how. And you use it or not. That\u2019s up to you.\u201d Not surprisingly, Rand solved the problem and created the \u201cjewel\u201d logo Jobs wanted, but the real lesson here is the effect\u00a0Rand\u2019s \u201cpush back\u201d had on Jobs, who later said of Rand, \u201cHe is one of the most professional people I have ever worked with: in the sense that he had thought through all of the formal relationship between a client and a professional such as himself.\u201d Rand took a risk when he said no. He bet a short-term popularity loss for a long-term gain in respect. And it paid off.\n\nEssentialists accept they cannot be popular with everyone all of the time. Yes, saying no respectfully, reasonably, and gracefully can come at a short-term social cost. But part of living the way of the Essentialist is realizing respect is far more valuable than popularity in the long run.\n\nREMEBERTHAT A CLEAR \u201cNO\u201d CAN BE MORE GRACEFUL THAN A VAGUE OR NONCOMMITTAL \u201cYES\u201d\n\nAs anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of this situation knows, a clear \u201cI am going to pass on this\u201d is far better than not getting back to someone or stringing them along with some noncommittal answer like \u201cI will try to make this work\u201d or \u201cI might be able to\u201d when you know you can\u2019t. Being vague is not the same as being graceful, and delaying the eventual \u201cno\u201d will only make it that much harder\u2014and the recipient that much more resentful.\"",

        "\"Mind Invited to Play\nThe value of play in our lives can\u2019t be overstated. Studies from the animal kingdom reveal that play is so crucial to the development of key cognitive skills it may even play a role in a species\u2019 survival. Bob Fagan, a researcher who has spent fifteen years studying the behavior of grizzly bears, discovered bears who played the most tended to survive the longest. When asked why, he said, \u201cIn a world continuously presenting unique challenges and ambiguity, play prepares these bears for a changing planet.\u201d4 Jaak Panksepp concluded something similar in Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, where he wrote, \u201cOne thing is certain, during play, animals are especially prone to behave in flexible and creative ways.\u201d5 Yet of all animal species, Stuart Brown writes, humans are the\nbiggest players of all. We are built to play and built through play. When we play, we are engaged in the purest expression of our humanity, the truest expression of our individuality. Is it any wonder that often the times we feel most alive, those that make up our best memories, are moments of play? Play expands our minds in ways that allow us to explore: to germinate new ideas or see old ideas in a new light. It makes us more inquisitive, more attuned to novelty, more engaged. Play is fundamental to living the way of the Essentialist because it fuels exploration in at least three specific ways. First, play broadens the range of options available to us. It helps\nus to see possibilities we otherwise wouldn\u2019t have seen and make connections we would otherwise not have made. It opens our minds and broadens our perspective. It helps us challenge old assumptions and makes us more receptive to untested ideas. It gives us permission to expand our own stream of consciousness and come up with new stories. Or as Albert Einstein once said: \u201cWhen I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.\u201d\n\n Second, play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because\nstress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain. You know how it feels: you\u2019re stressed about work and suddenly everything starts going wrong. You can\u2019t find your keys, you bump into things more easily, you forget the critical report on the kitchen table. Recent findings suggest this is because stress increases the activity in the part of the brain that monitors emotions (the amygdala), while reducing the activity in the part responsible for cognitive function (the hippocampus)7\u2014the result being, simply, that we really can\u2019t think clearly. I have seen play reverse these effects in my own children. When\nthey are stressed and things feel out of control, I have them draw. When they do, the change is almost immediate. The stress melts away and their ability to explore is regained. Third, as Edward M. Hallowell, a psychiatrist who specializes in\nbrain science, explains, play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain. \u201cThe brain\u2019s executive functions,\u201d he writes, \u201cinclude planning, prioritizing, scheduling, anticipating, delegating, deciding, analyzing\u2014in short, most of the skills any executive\n must master in order to excel in business.\u201d \"",

But with zero-based budgeting, they use zero as the baseline. In other words, every item in the proposed budget must be justified\u00a0 from scratch. While this takes more effort\u00a0it has many advantages: it efficiently\u00a0allocates resources on the basis of needs rather than history, it detects exaggerated budget requests, it draws attention to obsolete operations, and it encourages people to be clearer in their purpose and how their expenses align to that project. You can apply zero-based budgeting to your own endeavors. Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off.\u00a0All previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you would add today. You can do this with everything from the financial\u00a0obligations you have to projects you are committed to, even relationships you are in. Every use of time, energy, or resources has to justify itself anew. If it no longer fits, eliminate it altogether.\n\nSTOP MAKING CASUAL COMMITMENTS\n\nSome people\u2019s days are full to the brim with soft commitments they have taken on unintentionally through an offhand comment or casual conversation they had somewhere with someone.\n\nFROM NOW ON, PAUSE BEFORE YOU SPEAK\n\nIt might sound obvious, but pausing for just five\u00a0seconds before offering\u00a0your services can greatly reduce the possibility of making a commitment you\u2019ll regret. Before the words \u201cThat sounds great, I\u2019d love to\u201d fly\u00a0out of your mouth, ask yourself, \u201cIs this essential?\u201d If you\u2019ve already made a casual commitment you\u2019re regretting, find\u00a0a nice way to worm your way out. Simply apologize and tell the person that when you made the commitment you didn\u2019t fully realize what it would entail.\n\nGET OVER THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT\n\nWe\u2019ve seen ample evidence in this chapter suggesting that the majority of us are naturally very loss-averse. As a result, one of the obstacles to uncommitting ourselves from a present course is the fear of missing out on something great.\n\nTO FIGHT THIS FEAR, RUN A REVERSE PILOT\n\nIn a reverse pilot you test whether removing an initiative or activity will have any negative consequences. For example, when an executive I work with took on a new senior role in the company, he inherited a process his predecessor had gone to a huge effort\u00a0to implement: a huge, highly visual report on a myriad of subjects produced for the other executives each week. It consumed enormous energy from his team, and he hypothesized that it was not adding a great deal of value to the company. So to test his hypothesis he ran a reverse pilot. He simply stopped publishing the report and waited to see what the response would be. What he found was that no one seemed to miss it; after several weeks nobody had even mentioned the report. As a result, he concluded that the report was not essential to the business and could be eliminated. By quietly eliminating or at least scaling back an activity for a few days or weeks you might be able to assess whether it is really making a difference or whether no one really cares.\"",

And while conforming to what people in a group expect of us\u2014what psychologists call normative conformity\u2014is no longer a matter of life and death, the desire is still deeply ingrained in us.7 This is why, whether it\u2019s an old friend who invites you to dinner or a boss who asks you to take on an important and high-profile project, or a neighbor who begs you to help with the PTA bake sale, the very thought of saying no literally brings us physical discomfort. We feel guilty. We don\u2019t want to let someone down. We are worried about damaging the relationship. But these emotions muddle our clarity. They distract us from the reality of the fact that either we can say no and regret it for a few minutes, or we can say yes and regret it for days, weeks, months, or even years.\n\nThe only way out of this trap is to learn to say no firmly, resolutely, and yet gracefully.

        "\"If you think you may be high on self-expression and a bit low on communication, here is your own seven-step program to apply in both business and social settings.\nIt starts with a genuine desire to communicate (which means \u201cto make common\u201d) with people.\n\n1. Take time to figure out the interest/knowledge level of your listener. If someone asked you for directions to some place, you would need to know where they are now, wouldn\u2019t you? You need to know their general familiarity with the area to effi ciently lead them from point A to point B. You may have to play mind reader here or ask a few initial exploratory questions. Be alert to all the information you can glean from the interaction to pick the most appropriate response to create a genuine connection with this particular person.\n\n2. Choose appropriate vocabulary. When you think about all the ways that people are different from each other, it\u2019s a wonder we can communicate at all! But more wonderful yet is our fabulously developed language that enables us to choose our words to fi t the circumstance. A summary for your neighbor is going to sound different from a report to your boss; the data dump for your colleague must differ from the social chat with the new hire. The use of highly technical language to a nontechnical person not only puzzles him but can make him feel stupid, thus creating huge and unnecessary distances between people (like you and your mother).\n\n3. References to occupation are a common feature of most introductions. Many occupations in science and technology have become so specialized that they defy easy description to the layperson. Your title or general job description may well serve as a barrier rather than a bridge to other people outside your industry (\u201cI\u2019m a computer architect\u201d). You need to construct that bridge by searching for images and experiences that your listener has had that might help you describe your work. Even if your work is nontechnical (\u201cI\u2019m a lab assistant\u201d), some fl eshing out with actual descriptive language helps your listener know you better (\u201cI make sure that the blood and urine samples are properly labeled, entered into the log, and delivered to the lab for analysis, among other things\u201d). Let me give you an example from my work as a personal communication coach. If asked about my work, I would gauge my answer for the person asking, like this: To a stay-at-home individual: \u201cYou know how a lot of people can\u2019t stand their voice on a recording?\u201d (She nods.) \u201cWell I\u2019m the person that helps them improve the sound of their voice.\u201d To a seven-year-old boy: \u201cAre there boys and girls in your class that don\u2019t talk as well as other kids?\u201d (He nods.) \u201cWell, I\u2019m the kind of teacher that helps them talk really well.\"To a corporate executive: \u201cI coach corporate executives how to be concise and powerful in their communications.\u201d\n\nNotice that I\u2019m telling them what I do, not\nwho I am.\n\n4. If you know you\u2019re going to be presenting information, think fi rst so it can be organized in a manner conducive to easy comprehension , and avoid subjecting other people to your awkward on-the-spot formulations. People do not like to sit through your hemming and hawing, sentence revisions, and repetitions. Don\u2019t take them into the kitchen when they just want the cake.\n\n5. Make it safe for people to ask for clarifi cation. Many people nod and smile and just hope to get to the end of the conversation without revealing that they are totally in the dark. There is the possibility of a serious misunderstanding with real consequences when the listener is too embarrassed to admit that he is snowed. Ethnic and cultural differences (including disinclination to admitting a lack of understanding) can also add additional danger to the assumption of a shared vocabulary.\n\n6. Get to the point immediately when speaking with decision makers. If they want data or detail, they\u2019ll ask for it. They\u2019ll have only so much attention for you so you must think of economy of presentation. If you can respect their time, they\u2019re likely to respect your mind.\n\n7. Select your small talk thoughtfully in social conversation. Chatting is the time for short pleasantries with speaking opportunities passing back and forth, much like the volley in a tennis game. Don\u2019t embark on detailed information, any story over 5 minutes in length, or anything intricate. These require a follow-up meeting to allow more focused attention. Social situations are for people interaction, not long monologues.\n\nIf you are willing to invest 50 percent of your\n\nattention in your listener/audience, you\u2019ll get a 100 percent reception from them.\"",
        "\"Short Person, Big Message\nThe person of short stature is surely aware of our cultural bias for the taller person. Short = child/weak; tall = adult/ strong; etc. If you don\u2019t deal with this successfully, you are possibly facing frustration, lowered self-esteem, a lack of career progression, and sometimes depression. I want to tell you about the amazing Julie who went from being a speech therapist for a major rehabilitation provider to being the director of all rehabilitation services in the company. Her \u201cproblem\u201d was that she was four-eleven and cute as the dickens. But she had three other characteristics in the mix: she was smart, she was focused on her goals, and she assumed responsibility for her impact (demeanor, appearance, and verbal communication). A deliberate and businesslike demeanor came to her easily, and she learned to act as if she were tall and successful.\n\n**Nonverbal Communication**\n\nCarriage: Posture must be upright, quasi-military. Don\u2019t have an inch that you relinquish to gravity. Get feedback about your carriage from friends or a video of you walking normally. Imagine a crown on your head that you hold up proudly. Head control is extremely important in establishing a mature, dignified demeanor. Don\u2019t we talk about being \u201clevelheaded\u201d? Make even your nodding purposeful.\n\nA person who holds himself up will appear to be confident and adult. Step back a pace from face-to-face interactions with tall persons so you don\u2019t distort your posture by craning your neck uncomfortably.\n\nClothing, another nonverbal cue, can make a huge difference in your physical impact. Fit is crucial here. Do not appear in any clothes that are too big for you or ill-fi tting in any way; it would really send the message of childwearing-adult-clothes. If you have any money to spend, spend it on tailoring.\n\nIf at all possible, you would be way ahead by consulting a wardrobe and image expert to help you select colors and styles that complement your personal style, flatter your physique, and set you off as \u201cvery well dressed.\u201d They also know where you are likely to find suitable choices for your professional presentations. A personal tailor can make the stylish and well-fi tted wardrobe you need. Both men and women should avoid cuffed trousers (or any strong horizontal lines).Men, make sure your tie doesn\u2019t hang down below your belt. In most human interactions, the dimensions of your character and self-respect will matter more than physical stature as people get to know you. But your carriage and wardrobe function importantly in first impressions.\n\n**Vocal Communication**\n\nYou may be short, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your voice has to sound small. You should have a mature voice with adult intonations. We all know that a high voice is associated with a small body (i.e., a child). Because you are very aware of this, you may try to push your voice down to the very bottom of your range. This just makes you sound desperate, and your voice will not sound good at all. Use more simple declarative sentences when you talk .

        "\"The nutritional rules for maximizing your mental energy while studying are simple:\n1. Drink water constantly. Have a water bottle with you, or make frequent trips to the water fountain. One of my favorite study spots had a dispenser of mini\u2013paper cups next to the fountain. My habit was to drink five mini-cups of water every forty-five minutes. It worked wonders toward keeping my mind humming and my energy high. Your body needs water to function. Hydration increases your energy, masks boredom-induced food cravings, and staves off sleepiness. And don\u2019t worry about the inevitable side effect of so much drinking. As Greta, a straight-A Dartmouth student, exults: \u201cFrequent bathroom trips keep me awake.\u201d\n\n2. Monitor your caffeine intake carefully. Don\u2019t drink more than one large caffeinated beverage in any one-hour period. While a Coke or cup of coffee can heighten your concentration, too much caffeine in a short period will make you jumpy and unfocused. If you\u2019re a coffee drinker, start off with a strong brew to jump-start your mind, but switch to decaf, tea, or just water for the next hour or two before returning to another strong drink.\n\n3. Treat food as a source of energy, not satisfaction. When studying, carefully choose satisfaction. When studying, carefully choose snacks that promise a long-term energy boost. Try vegetables, fruit, anything whole grain, lean proteins, peanuts, or natural granola bars. Refined carbohydrates, such as sugar and white flour, will provide only a quick energy rush followed immediately by a damaging energy drain and increased appetite. Avoid these unhealthy snacks at all costs while working. If you follow rule one, your frequent water consumption will dull the cravings for specific foods, making it much easier to stick with healthier fare.\n\n4. Don\u2019t skip meals. Snacks alone are not enough to fuel your mind for long periods. Even on the busiest of days, eat regular meals. If you skip breakfast to get a jump start on studying, or put off lunch until the late afternoon so you can finish your reading, you will experience more hunger than your snacks can effectively satisfy. Hunger, and the corresponding low blood sugar, will rob you of your ability to concentrate and set you up to succumb to procrastination. So keep your meals regular. If you\u2019re pressed for time, eat fast. Grab a sandwich from a less-populated dining hall and sit alone, or bring part of the meal back to your study location. But never miss meals altogether.\"",

If the exam is multiple choice or contains many questions, skim through quickly and get a feel for which topics are covered.\n\nStrategy #2: Build a Time Budget\n\nFirst, take the time allotted for the exam and subtract ten minutes. Next, divide this amount by the number of questions. The result is how long you have to spend on each prompt.\n\nStrategy #3: Proceed from Easy to Hard\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it first focuses your energy on the questions you know the most about, ensuring that you get maximum points on these. It also gives you a better chance of conquering the more difficult ones.\n\nStrategy #4: Outline Essays\n\nTo do so, use the margin of the exam to jot down all of the points you can recall that are relevant to the question. Record only a few key words for each point to save time and space.\n\nStrategy #5: Check Your Work\n\nIf, after your first round of review, you still have time left over, then go through and check again.It\u2019s tempting to relax after finishing your exam, perhaps walking proudly to the front of the classroom and handing it in before anyone else.

It\u2019s not going anywhere.\n\nThe same is not true if you merely read over something. Passively reviewing a concept is not the same as actively producing it.

        "\"I realized what the other employees already knew\u2014that the most successful waiter in the place was Vincent, who somehow arranged for patrons to order more and tip higher than for anyone else; in fact, the other servers were not even close to him in weekly earnings.\nSo I began to linger in my duties around Vincent\u2019s tables to observe his style. I quickly learned that his style was to have no single style. He had a repertoire of them, each ready to be called on under the appropriate circumstances. When the customers were a family, he was effervescent\u2014even slightly clownish\u2014directing his remarks as often to the children as to the adults. With a young couple on a date, he became formal and a bit imperious in an attempt to intimidate the young man (to whom he spoke exclusively) into ordering and tipping lavishly. With an older, married couple, he retained the formality but dropped the superior air in favor of a respectful orientation to both members of the couple. Should the patron be dining alone, Vincent selected a friendly demeanor\u2014cordial, conversational, and warm. But Vincent reserved the trick of seeming to argue against his own interests for large parties of eight to twelve people. Here his technique was veined with genius. When it was time for the first person, normally a lady, to order, he went into his act. No matter what she selected, Vincent reacted identically: His brow furrowed, his hand hovered above his order pad, and after looking quickly over his shoulder for the manager, he leaned conspiratorially toward the table to report for all to hear, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that is not as good tonight as it normally is. Might I recommend instead the \\_\\_\\_\\_or the\\_\\_\\_\\_?\u201d (Here Vincent suggested a pair of menu items that were fifty cents or so less expensive than the dish the patron had selected initially.) \u201cThey are both excellent tonight.\u201d With this single maneuver, Vincent engaged several important principles of influence. First, even those who did not take his suggestions felt that Vincent had done them a favor by offering valuable information to help them order. Everyone felt grateful, and consequently the rule for reciprocity would work in his favor when it came time to decide on his gratuity. But besides hiking the percentage of his tip, Vincent\u2019s maneuver also placed him in a favorable position to increase the size of the table\u2019s order. It established him as an authority on the current stores of the house; he clearly knew what was and wasn\u2019t good that night. Moreover\u2014and this is where seeming to argue against his own interests came in\u2014it proved him to be a trustworthy informant, because he recommended dishes that were slightly less expensive than originally ordered. Rather than trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have the customers\u2019 best interests at heart. To all appearances, he was at once knowledgeable and honest, a combination that gave him great credibility. And Vincent was quick to exploit the advantage of this credible image. When the party had finished giving their food orders, he would say, \u201cVery well, and would you like me to suggest or select some wine to go with your meals?\u201d As I watched the scene repeated almost nightly, there was a notable consistency to the customers\u2019 reactions\u2014smiles, nods, and for the most part, general assent. Even from the distance of my vantage point, one could read their thoughts from their faces. \u201cSure,\u201d they seemed to say, \u201cyou know what\u2019s good here, and you\u2019re obviously on our side. Tell us what to get.\u201d Looking pleased, Vincent, who did know his vintages, would respond with some excellent (and costly) choices. He was similarly persuasive when it came time for dessert decisions. Patrons who otherwise would have passed up the dessert course or shared with a friend were swayed to partake fully by Vincent\u2019s rapturous descriptions of the Baked Alaska and chocolate mousse. Who, after all, is more believable than a demonstrated expert of proven sincerity? By combining the factors of reciprocity and credible authority into a single, elegant maneuver, Vincent was able to inflate substantially both the percentage of his tip and the base charge on which it was figured. His proceeds from this trick were handsome, indeed. But notice that much of his profit came from an apparent lack of concern for personal profit. Seeming to argue against his financial interests served those interests extremely well.\"",

        "\"A wellknown principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason.\nPeople simply like to have reasons for what they do. Langer demonstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I\u2019m in a rush? The effectiveness of this request-plus-reason was nearly total: Ninety-four percent of those asked let her skip ahead of them in line. Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine? Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those asked complied. At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference between the two requests was the additional information provided by the words \u201cbecause I\u2019m in a rush.\u201d But a third type of request tried by Langer showed that this was not the case. It seems that it was not the whole series of words, but the first one, \u201cbecause,\u201d that made the difference. Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer\u2019s third type of request used the word \u201cbecause\u201d and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies? The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information, was added to justify their compliance. Just as the \u201ccheep-cheep\u201d sound of turkey chicks triggered an automatic mothering response from maternal turkeys\u2014even when it emanated from a stuffed polecat\u2014so, too, did the word \u201cbecause\u201d trigger an automatic compliance response from Langer\u2019s subjects, even when they were given no subsequent reason to comply.\"",

Consequently, we won\u2019t feel committed to it.

It suggests that we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably produce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want more than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness of what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the desired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pressures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner responsibility for the actions we want them to take.",

Any subsequent retreat from that wholly unrealistic initial position is not viewed as a genuine concession and thus is not reciprocated.

He says he has friends in the district attorney\u2019s office who will hear from him of the suspect\u2019s noncooperative attitude and who will prosecute the case hard.\nAt the outset of Bad Cop\u2019s performance, his partner, Good Cop, sits in the background. Then, slowly, he starts to chip in. First he speaks only to Bad Cop, trying to temper the burgeoning anger. \u201cCalm down, Frank, calm down.\u201d But Bad Cop shouts back, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me to calm down when he\u2019s lying right to my face! I hate these lying bastards!\u201d A bit later, Good Cop actually says something in the suspect\u2019s behalf. \u201cTake it easy, Frank, he\u2019s only a kid.\u201d Not much in the way of support, but compared to the rantings of Bad Cop, the words fall like music on the prisoner\u2019s ears. Still, Bad Cop is unconvinced. \u201cKid? He\u2019s no kid. He\u2019s a punk. That\u2019s what he is, a punk. And I\u2019ll tell you something else. He\u2019s over eighteen, and that\u2019s all I need to get his ass sent so far behind bars they\u2019ll need a flashlight to find him.\u201d\nNow Good Cop begins to speak directly to the young man, calling him by his first name and pointing out any positive details of the case. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Kenny, you\u2019re lucky that nobody was hurt and you weren\u2019t armed. When you come up for sentencing, that\u2019ll look good.\u201d If the suspect persists in claiming innocence, Bad Cop launches into another tirade of curses and threats. But this time Good Cop stops him, \u201cOkay, Frank,\u201d handing Bad Cop some money, \u201cI think we could all use some coffee. How about getting us three cups?\u201d When Bad Cop is gone, it\u2019s time for Good Cop\u2019s big scene: \u201cLook, man, I don\u2019t know why, but my partner doesn\u2019t like you, and he\u2019s gonna try to get you. And he\u2019s gonna be able to do it because we\u2019ve got enough evidence right now. And he\u2019s right about the D.A.\u2019s office going hard on guys who don\u2019t cooperate. You\u2019re looking at five years, man, five years! Now, I don\u2019t want to see that happen to you. So if you admit you robbed that place right now, before he gets back, I\u2019ll take charge of your case and put in a good word for you to the D.A. If we work together on this, we can cut that five years down to two, maybe one. Do us both a favor, Kenny. Just tell me how you did it, and then let\u2019s start working on getting you through this.\u201d A full confession frequently follows.\nGood Cop/Bad Cop works as well as it does for several reasons: The fear of long incarceration is quickly instilled by Bad Cop\u2019s threats; the perceptual contrast principle ensures that compared to the raving, venomous Bad Cop, the interrogator playing Good Cop will seem like an especially reasonable and kind man; and because Good Cop has intervened repeatedly on the suspect\u2019s behalf\u2014has even spent his own money for a cup of coffee\u2014the reciprocity rule pressures for a return favor. The big reason that the technique is effective, though, is that it gives the suspect the idea that there is someone on his side, someone with his welfare in mind, someone working together with him, for him. In most situations, such a person would be viewed very favorably, but in the deep trouble our robbery suspect finds himself, that person takes on the character of a savior. And from savior, it is but a short step to trusted father confessor.\"",
        "\"Let\u2019s return to the Regan study, where we find that the favor causing subjects to double the number of raffle tickets purchased from Joe was not one they had requested.\nJoe had voluntarily left the room and returned with one Coke for himself and one for the subject. There was not a single subject who refused the Coke. It is easy to see why it would have been awkward to turn down Joe\u2019s favor: Joe had already spent his money; a soft drink was an appropriate favor in the situation, especially since Joe had one himself; it would have been considered impolite to reject Joe\u2019s thoughtful action. Nevertheless, receipt of that Coke produced an indebtedness that manifested itself clearly when Joe announced his desire to sell some raffle tickets. Notice the important asymmetry here\u2014all the genuinely free choices were Joe\u2019s. He chose the form of the initial favor, and he chose the form of the return favor. Of course, one could say that the subject had the choice of saying no to both of Joe\u2019s offers. But those would have been tough choices. To have said no at either point would have required the subject to go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation arrangements that Jujitsu Joe had aligned himself with.\"",
        "\"Although it is generally acknowledged that good-looking people have an advantage in social interaction, recent findings indicate that we may have sorely underestimated the size and reach of that advantage. There seems to be a click, whirr response to attractive people. Like all click, whirr reactions, it happens automatically, without forethought. The response itself falls into a category that social scientists call \u201chalo effects.\u201d A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others. And the evidence is now clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic.\nResearch has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence. Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. Certain of the consequences of this unconscious assumption that \u201cgood-looking equals good\u201d scare me. For example, a study of the Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates.1 Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demonstrated that voters do not realize their bias. In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence. A similar effect has been found in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications\u2014this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices.\n\nEqually unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone structure. Good-looking people are likely to receive highly favorable treatment in the legal system. For example, in a Pennsylvania study, researchers rated the physical attractiveness of seventy-four separate male defendants at the start of their criminal trials. When, much later, the researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sentences. In fact, the attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as the unattractive ones.3 In another study\u2014this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial\u2014a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average compensation was $10,051. What\u2019s more, both male and female jurors exhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism.\n\nIt is hardly any wonder, then, that the halo of physical attractiveness is regularly exploited by compliance professionals. Because we like attractive people and because we tend to comply with those we like, it makes sense that sales training programs include grooming hints, that fashionable clothiers select their floor staffs from among the good looking candidates, and that con men are handsome and con women pretty.\"",

        "\"Suppose a man enters a fashionable men\u2019s store and says that he wants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you were the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him likely to spend the most money?\nClothing stores instruct their sales personnel to sell the costly item first. Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more on the purchase of a sweater. But the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at the idea of spending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seem excessive. The same principle applies to a man who wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes, belt) to go along with his new suit. Contrary to the commonsense view, the evidence supports the contrast-principle prediction. As sales motivation analysts Whitney, Hubin, and Murphy state, \u201cThe interesting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before.\u201d It is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first, not only because to fail to do so will lose the influence of the contrast principle; to fail to do so will also cause the principle to work actively against them. Presenting an inexpensive product first and following it with an expensive one will cause the expensive item to seem even more costly as a result\u2014hardly a desirable consequence for most sales organizations.\"",

Yet they specifically chose to employ the smaller rather than the larger, more motivating rewards. Although the settings are quite different, the surveyed fraternities refused to allow civic activities into their initiation ceremonies for the same reason that the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had done. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A man who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay with a few anti-American comments could not be permitted to shrug it off as motivated by a big reward.

We don\u2019t attempt to restrain the influence of the factors that cause liking. Quite the contrary.

        "\"There is a second way to employ the reciprocity rule to get someone to comply with a request. It is more subtle than the direct route of providing that person with a favor and then asking for one in return; yet in some ways it is more devastatingly effective than the straightforward approach.\nA personal experience I had a few years ago gave me firsthand evidence of just how well this compliance technique works. I was walking down the street when I was approached by an elevenor twelve-year-old boy. He introduced himself and said that he was selling tickets to the annual Boy Scouts circus to be held on the upcoming Saturday night. He asked if I wished to buy any at five dollars apiece. Since one of the last places I wanted to spend Saturday evening was with the Boy Scouts, I declined. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to buy any tickets, how about buying some of our big chocolate bars? They\u2019re only a dollar each.\u201d I bought a couple and, right away, realized that something noteworthy had happened. I knew that to be the case because: (a) I do not like chocolate bars; (b) I do like dollars; (c) I was standing there with two of his chocolate bars; and (d) he was walking away with two of my dollars.\n\nTo try to understand precisely what had happened, I went to my office and called a meeting of my research assistants. In discussing the situation, we began to see how the reciprocity rule was implicated in my compliance with the request to buy the candy bars. The general rule says that a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action. We have already seen that one consequence of the rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received. Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us. As my research group thought about it, we realized that was exactly the position the Boy Scout had put me in. His request that I purchase some one-dollar chocolate bars had been put in the form of a concession on his part; it was presented as a retreat from his request that I buy some five-dollar tickets. If I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to be a concession on my part. As we have seen, there was such a concession: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered.\n\nIt was a classic example of how a weapon of automatic influence can infuse a compliance request with its power. \"",

        "\"Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.\nA handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\n\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\n\nGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning\u2014the survivors\u2014and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn\u2019t succeed.\n\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants\n\nto get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn\u2019t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before\u2014just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.\n\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\n\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room\u2014for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you\u2019ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You\u2019re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That\u2019s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\n\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\n\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: \u201cOnce I reach my goal, then I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you\u2019re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I\u2019ve slipped into this trap so many times I\u2019ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. Furthermore, goals create an \u201ceither-or\u201d conflict: either you achieve\n\nyour goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don\u2019t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\n\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\n\nFinally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a \u201cyo-yo\u201d effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It\u2019s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\"",

The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.\n\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won\u2019t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, \u201cThat\u2019s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.\u201d\n\nRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.\n\nNegative Compounding\n\nStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.\n\nNegative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.\n\nOutrage compounds. Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely the result of a single event.

        "\"Little Lessons from the Four Laws\nCue, craving, response, reward. This framework not only teaches us how to create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights about human behavior.\n\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\n\nI have compiled some lessons that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing human behavior.\n\n**Awareness comes before desire. **A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.\n\n**Happiness is simply the absence of desire**. When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state. However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, \u201cHappiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.\u201d Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.\n\n**It is the idea of pleasure that we chase.** We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.\n\n**Peace occurs when you don\u2019t turn your observations into problems.** The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace. Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You\u2019re simply observing and existing.\n\n**With a big enough why you can overcome any how**. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, \u201cHe who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\u201d This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you\u2019ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action\u2014even when friction is high.\n\n**Being curious is better than being smart.** Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn\u2019t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, \u201cThe trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.\u201d\n\n**Emotions drive behavior. **Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.\n\n**We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. **The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response\u2014the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain\u2014is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response\u2014the slow, conscious portion of the brain\u2014is the part that does the \u201cthinking.\u201d Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.\n\n**Your response tends to follow your emotions.** Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two people can notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run those facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making. Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the one that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.\n\n**Suffering drives progress. **The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.\n\n**Your actions reveal how badly you want something.** If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don\u2019t really want it. It\u2019s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.\n\n**Reward is on the other side of sacrifice. **Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.\n\n**Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. **A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.\n\n**Our expectations determine our satisfaction. **The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied.\n\nSatisfaction = Liking \u2013 Wanting\n\nThis is the wisdom behind Seneca\u2019s famous quote, \u201cBeing poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.\u201d If your wants outpace your likes, you\u2019ll always be unsatisfied. You\u2019re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution. Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didn\u2019t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn\u2019t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn\u2019t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.\n\n**The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.** When desire is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn\u2019t think much about in the first place. This is why people say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get my hopes up.\u201d\n\n**Feelings come both before and after the behavior.** Before acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act\u2014the craving. After acting, there is a feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future\u2014the reward.\n\nCue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)\nHow we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel.\n\n**Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.** Wanting and liking are the two drivers of behavior. If it\u2019s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it\u2019s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.\n\n**Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. **The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on promise. The second time around, your expectation is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your hope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the likely outcome. This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don\u2019t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, \u201cYouth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.\u201d Perhaps this can be revised to \u201cYouth is easily deceived because it only hopes.\u201d There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning, hope is all you have\"",

As someone said:\nGod has not promised\nSkies always blue,\nFlower-strewn pathways\nAll our life through;\nGod has not promised\nSun without rain,\nJoy without sorrow,\nPeace without pain.\n\nI will not be presumptuous enough to say that my life can be a role model for anybody; but some poor child living in an obscure place, in an underprivileged social setting may find a little solace in the way my destiny has been shaped.

I would like to share with you two techniques I adopt in this regard.\nFirst, by building your own education and skills. Knowledge is a tangible asset, quite often the most important tool in your work. The more up-to-date the knowledge you possess, the freer you are. Knowledge cannot be taken away from anyone except by obsolescence. A leader can only be free to lead his team if he keeps abreast of all that is happening around him\u2014in real time. To lead, in a way, is to engage in continuing education. In many countries, it is normal for professionals to go to college several nights every week. To be a successful team leader, one has to stay back after the din and clutter of a working day to emerge better-equipped and ready to face a new day.\"",

After all, what is life but a mixture of unsolved problems, ambiguous victories, and amorphous defeats?\nThe trouble is that we often merely analyse life instead of dealing with it. People dissect their failures for causes and effects, but seldom deal with them and gain experience to master them and thereby avoid their recurrence.

I have observed an analogy between a force field equilibrium and resistance to change in organizations. Let us imagine change to be a coiled spring in a field of opposing forces, such that some forces support change and others resist it. By increasing the supportive forces such as supervisory pressure, prospects of career growth and monetary benefits or decreasing the resisting forces such as group norms, social rewards, and work avoidance, the situation can be directed towards the desired result\u2014but for a short time only, and that too only to a certain extent. After a while the resisting forces push back with greater force as they are compressed even more tightly. Therefore, a better approach would be to decrease the resisting force in such a manner that there is no concomittant increase in the supporting forces. In this way, less energy will be needed to bring about and maintain change.\nThe result of the forces I mentioned above, is motive.

At length the warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknown wishes. Inflamed by the flatteries of men, her former pleasures become by degrees insipid, till at length she meets with a youth to whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling; upon him she now rests all her hopes; she forgets the world around her; she sees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only.\n\nHe alone occupies all her thoughts.

Sometimes I lie stretched on the ground, overcome with fatigue and dying with thirst; sometimes, late in the night, when the moon shines above me, I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest, to rest my weary limbs, when, exhausted and worn, I sleep till break of day.

        "\"This is another of your extravagant humours, you always exaggerate a case, and in this matter you are undoubtedly wrong;\nfor we were speaking of suicide, which you compare with great actions, when it is impossible to regard it as anything but a weakness. It is much easier to die than to bear a life of misery with fortitude.\n\n\"You call this a weakness\u2014 beware of being led astray by appearances. When a nation, which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at last and throws off its chains, do you call that weakness? The man who, to rescue his house from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, so that he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of excitement, he could scarcely move; he who, under the rage of an insult, attacks and puts to flight half a score of his enemies, are such persons to be called weak? My good friend, if resistance be strength, how can the highest degree of resistance be a weakness?\" Albert looked steadfastly at me, and said, \"Pray forgive me, but I do not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relation to the question.\" \"Very likely,\" I answered; \"for I have often been told that my style of illustration borders a little on the absurd. But let us see if we cannot place the matter in another point of view, by inquiring what can be a man's state of mind who resolves to free himself from the burden of life,\u2014a burden often so pleasant to bear,\u2014for we cannot otherwise reason fairly upon the subject. \"Human nature,\" I continued, \"has its limits. It is able to endure a certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated as soon as this measure is exceeded. The question, therefore, is, not whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to endure the measure of his sufferings. The suffering may be moral or physical; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroys himself, as to call a man a coward who dies of a malignant fever.\" \"Paradox, all paradox!\" exclaimed Albert. \"Not so paradoxical as you imagine,\" I replied. \"You allow that we designate a disease as mortal when nature is so severely attacked, and her strength so far exhausted, that she cannot possibly recover her former condition under any change that may take place. \"Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in his natural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and how impressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizes him, destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterly ruining him. \"It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands the condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him.

        "\"We are so constituted by nature, that we are ever prone to compare ourselves with others; and our happiness or misery depends very much on the objects and persons around us.\nOn this account, nothing is more dangerous than solitude: there our imagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new flight on the wings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seem the most inferior. All things appear greater than they really are, and all seem superior to us. This operation of the mind is quite natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, and fancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess, attributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by this process we form the idea of a perfect, happy man,\u2014a man, however, who only exists in our own imagination. But when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work in earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though obliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who have the assistance of wind and tide; and, in truth, there can be no greater satisfaction than to keep pace with others or outstrip them in the race.\"",

Is there not a woman in the whole world who is at liberty, and has the power to make you happy? Conquer yourself: look for such a being, and believe me when I say that you will certainly find her. I have long felt for you, and for us all: you have confined yourself too long within the limits of too narrow a circle. Conquer yourself; make an effort: a short journey will be of service to you.

When you write down a goal, you crystallize it and give it tangible form. You create something that you can touch and see. On the other hand, a goal or objective that is not in writing is merely a wish or a fantasy. It has no energy behind it. Unwritten goals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection, and numerous mistakes.\n\nStep three: Set a deadline on your goal; set subdeadlines if necessary. A goal\n\nor decision without a deadline has no urgency. It has no real beginning or end. Without a definite deadline accompanied by the assignment or acceptance of specific responsibilities for completion, you will naturally procrastinate and get very little done.\n\nStep four: Make a list of everything you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal. As you think of new activities, add them to your list. Keep building your list until it is complete. A list gives you a visual picture of the larger task or objective. It gives you a track to run on. It dramatically increases the likelihood that you will achieve your goal as you have defined it and on schedule.\n\nStep five: Organize the list into a plan. Organize your list by priority and sequence. List all tasks in the order they need to be done. Take a few minutes to decide what you need to do first and what you can do later. Decide what has to be done before something else and what needs to be done afterward. Even better, lay out your plan visually in the form of a series of boxes and\n\ncircles on a sheet of paper, with lines and arrows showing the relationship of each task to every other task. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much easier it is to achieve your goal when you break it down into individual tasks. With a written goal and an organized plan of action, you will be far more productive and efficient than people who are carrying their goals around in their minds.\n\nStep six: Take action on your plan immediately. Do something. Do anything. An average plan vigorously executed is far better than a brilliant plan on which nothing is done. For you to achieve any kind of success, execution is everything.\n\nStep seven: Resolve to do something every single day that moves you toward your major goal. Build this activity into your daily schedule. You may decide to read a specific number of pages on a key subject. You may call on a specific number of prospects or customers. You may engage in a specific period of physical exercise. You may learn a certain number of new words in a foreign language. Whatever it is, you must never miss a day. Keep pushing forward. Once you start moving, keep moving. Don\u2019t stop.\n\nThis decision, this discipline alone, can dramatically increase your speed of goal accomplishment and boost your personal productivity.\"",

Take it one oil barrel at a time: You can accomplish the biggest and most complicated job if you just complete it one step at a time.\n\n11.

Identify your key constraints: Determine the bottlenecks or choke points, internal or external, that set the speed at which you achieve your most important goals, and focus on alleviating them.\n\n13.

And that doggedness depends on emotional traits\u2014enthusiasm and persistence in the face of setbacks\u2014above all else. The added payoff for life success from motivation, apart from other innate abilities, can be seen in the remarkable performance of Asian students in American schools and professions. One thorough review of the evidence suggests that Asian-American children may have an average IQ advantage over whites of just two or three points. Yet on the basis of the professions, such as law and medicine, that many Asian-Americans end up in, as a group they behave as though their IQ were much higher\u2014the equivalent of an IQ of 110 for Japanese-Americans and of 120 for Chinese Americans. 6The reason seems to be that from the earliest years of school, Asian children work harder than whites.

        "\"Scaling Up\nOnce you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff Bezos\u2019s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books. There were millions of books to catalog, but they all had roughly the same shape, they were easy to ship, and some of the most rarely sold books\u2014those least profitable for any retail store to keep in stock\u2014also drew the most enthusiastic customers. Amazon became the dominant solution for anyone located far from a bookstore or seeking something unusual. Amazon then had two options: expand the number of people who read books, or expand to adjacent markets. They chose the latter, starting with the most similar markets: CDs, videos, and software. Amazon continued to add categories gradually until it had become the world\u2019s general store. The name itself brilliantly encapsulated the company\u2019s scaling strategy. The biodiversity of the Amazon rain forest reflected Amazon\u2019s first goal of cataloging every book in the world, and now it stands for every kind of thing in the world, period. eBay also started by dominating small niche markets. When it launched its auction marketplace in 1995, it didn\u2019t need the whole world to adopt it at once; the product worked well for intense interest groups, like Beanie Baby obsessives. Once it monopolized the Beanie Baby trade, eBay didn\u2019t jump straight to listing sports cars or industrial surplus: it continued to cater to small-time hobbyists until it became the most reliable marketplace for people trading online no matter what the item. Sometimes there are hidden obstacles to scaling\u2014a lesson that eBay has learned in recent years. Like all marketplaces, the auction marketplace lent itself to natural monopoly because buyers go where the sellers are and vice versa. But eBay found that the auction model works best for individually distinctive products like coins and stamps. It works less well for commodity products: people don\u2019t want to bid on pencils or Kleenex, so it\u2019s more convenient just to buy them from Amazon. eBay is still a valuable monopoly; it\u2019s just smaller than people in 2004 expected it to be.

Economies of Scale\nA monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a product (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales. Software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost of producing another copy of the product is close to zero. Many businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale.\nService businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for example, you\u2019ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you\u2019ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to do. A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first\ndesign. Twitter already has more than 250 million users today. It doesn\u2019t need to add too many customized features in order to acquire more, and there\u2019s no inherent reason why it should ever stop growing.\"",

        "\"4. Branding\nA company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. Today\u2019s strongest tech brand is Apple: the attractive looks and carefully chosen materials of products like the iPhone and MacBook, the Apple Stores\u2019 sleek minimalist design and close control over the consumer experience, the omnipresent advertising campaigns, the price positioning as a maker of premium goods, and the lingering nimbus of Steve Jobs\u2019s personal charisma all contribute to a perception that Apple offers products so good as to constitute a category of their own. Many have tried to learn from Apple\u2019s success: paid advertising, branded\nstores, luxurious materials, playful keynote speeches, high prices, and even minimalist design are all susceptible to imitation. But these techniques for polishing the surface don\u2019t work without a strong underlying substance. Apple has a complex suite of proprietary technologies, both in hardware (like superior touchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen interfaces purposedesigned for specific materials). It manufactures products at a scale large enough to dominate pricing for the materials it buys. And it enjoys strong network effects from its content ecosystem: thousands of developers write software for Apple devices because that\u2019s where hundreds of millions of users are, and those users stay on the platform because it\u2019s where the apps are. These other monopolistic advantages are less obvious than Apple\u2019s sparkling brand, but they are the fundamentals that let the branding effectively reinforce Apple\u2019s monopoly. Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. Ever since Marissa\nMayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the oncepopular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized Mayer\u2019s plan as a chain reaction of \u201cpeople then products then traffic then revenue.\u201d The people are supposed to come for the coolness: Yahoo! demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer\u2019s own star power. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn\u2019t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology company can be built on branding alone.\"",

        "\"1. Proprietary Technology\nProprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google\u2019s search algorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else\u2019s. Proprietary technologies for extremely short page load times and highly accurate query autocompletion add to the core search product\u2019s robustness and defensibility. It would be very hard for anyone to do to Google what Google did to all the other search engine companies in the early 2000s. As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times\nbetter than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something\ncompletely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness, for example, would certainly support a monopoly business.\nOr you can radically improve an existing solution: once you\u2019re 10x better, you\nescape competition. PayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10 times better. Instead of mailing a check that would take 7 to 10 days to arrive, PayPal let buyers pay as soon as an auction ended. Sellers received their proceeds right away, and unlike with a check, they knew the funds were good. Amazon made its first 10x improvement in a particularly visible way: they offered at least 10 times as many books as any other bookstore. When it launched in 1995, Amazon could claim to be \u201cEarth\u2019s largest bookstore\u201d because, unlike a retail bookstore that might stock 100,000 books, Amazon didn\u2019t need to physically store any inventory\u2014it simply requested the title from its supplier whenever a customer made an order. This quantum improvement was so effective that a very unhappy Barnes & Noble filed a lawsuit three days before Amazon\u2019s IPO, claiming that Amazon was unfairly calling itself a \u201cbookstore\u201d when really it was a \u201cbook broker.\u201d You can also make a 10x improvement through superior integrated design. Before 2010, tablet computing was so poor that for all practical purposes the market didn\u2019t even exist. \u201cMicrosoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition\u201d products first shipped in 2002, and Nokia released its own \u201cInternet Tablet\u201d in 2005, but they were a pain to use. Then Apple released the iPad. Design improvements are hard to measure, but it seems clear that Apple improved on anything that had come before by at least an order of magnitude: tablets went from unusable to useful.\"",

Improve on the competition\nDon\u2019t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.\n\n4. Focus on product, not sales\nIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.\n\nThese lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would\nignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:\n\n1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. \n\n2. A bad plan is better than no plan. \n\n3.

In 70 percent of these households, the male contributes at least 80 percent of the income. Most of these men play great offense in the game called income generation. Great offense in economic terms means that a household generates an income significantly higher than the norm, which in America is an annual realized income of approximately $33,000. Most of these households also play great defense; that is, they are frugal when it comes to spending for consumer goods and services. One frugal high-income producer within the married-couple category, however, does not automatically translate into a high level of net worth. Something else must be present. A self-made millionaire stated it best when he told us: I can't get my wife to spend any money! Most people will never become wealthy in one generation if they are married to people who are wasteful.

        "\"RULES FOR AFFLUENT PARENTS AND PRODUCTIVE CHILDREN\n1. Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.\n\nWhy is it that many of the adult children of UAWs are more likely to earn high incomes than to accumulate wealth? We believe one of the major reasons is that as children they were constantly told their parents were wealthy. Adult UAWs tend to be the product of parents who lived in ways they thought appropriate for wealthy people to act. They lived the high-status/high-consumption lifestyle so popular in America today. It's no wonder their sons and daughters attempt to emulate them. Conversely, adult PAWs whose parents were wealthy have told us time and time again: I never knew my dad was wealthy until I became executor of his estate. He never looked it.\n\n2. No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children discipline and frugality.\n\nWe profiled Dr. North, a wealthy man whose adult children live frugal, well-disciplined lives. Dr. North detailed how he and his wife raised their children. Simply stated, they taught by example. Their children were exposed to credible role models whose lives were characterized by their discipline and frugality. Dr. North said it best: Kids are very smart. They will not follow rules that their parents themselves do not follow. We [my wife and I] were well disciplined parents.... We lived the rules... we taught by example.... They [the children] learned by example. There must be congruency between what parents tell their children to do and what we as parents do. Kids are very perceptive in pointing out inconsistencies. Dr. North received a birthday gift from one of his daughters when she was twelve. It was a poster titled \"The King's Rules.\" On it, his daughter wrote down the rules that her father preached to his children. Dr. North still keeps this poster in his office, prominently displayed behind his desk. Kids are looking for discipline and rules. She honored me with the poster. Kids must be trained to take responsibility for their actions. Today all my children are well disciplined and frugal. They adhered to the rules. Why? Because their parents did.... Actions speak louder than rules that are just words, not actions.\n\n3. Assure that your children won't realize you're affluent until alter they have established a mature, disciplined, and adult lifestyle and profession.\n\nOnce again, Dr. North said it best: I have set up trusts for my children . . . some estate tax advantages. But my plan will not distribute money to my children until they are forty years of age or older. Because in this way my money will have little effect on their way of life at that age. They will have already adopted their own lifestyle. Dr. North also told us that he never gives his children cash gifts, not even now that they are adults. Cash gives them too many options,... especially in the case of young children. Media, especially T~ controls the values of our young. Just like they try to control what we think is funny with canned laughter.... [There's] too much emphasis on consumption. . . . I have never just given cash for this reason. What I have always told my children [is] if you need to make a major purchase, you first must fund a good bit of it yourself.\n\n4. Minimize discussions of the items that each child and grandchild will inherit or receive as gifts\n\nNever make light of verbal promises: \"Billy, you will get the house; Bob, the summer cottage; Barbara, the silver,\" especially in a group setting, especially when consuming alcohol. You may too easily forget or confuse who gets what, but the kids are not likely to forget. They will hold you and their siblings responsible for being shorted. False promises often lead to discord and conflicts.\n\n5. Never give cash or other significant gifts to your adult children as part of a negotiation strategy.\n\nGive because of love, even obligation and kindness. Adult children often lose their respect and love for parents who submit to high-pressure negotiating tactics. Coercion of this type is often the product of the manner in which parents negotiate with their young children. Even preteens are taught the benefits of \"Johnny got a bike so I should get a wagon.\" Johnny and his brother should receive symbols of love and kindness but, instead, they learn that Mom and Dad must be pushed, squeezed, and coerced into giving. The boys may begin to view each other as adversaries. Often parents perpetuate conflicts even among their adult children. Have you ever told one of your children or grandchildren something like the following: We helped your brother remodel his house/sent his kids to private school/paid his health insurance. We want you to have a few extra dollars. Would $5,000 be all right? What's wrong with such offers? Often those on the receiving end view them as signs of guilt or appeasement on the part of their parents.\n\n6. Stay out of your adult children's family matters.\n\nPlease note, parents, that your vision of the ideal lifestyle may be diametrically opposed to that of your adult son or daughter, as well as that of your son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Adult children resent interference from their parents. Let them run their own lives; ask permission even to give advice. Ask permission also when contemplating giving significant gifts to your children.\n\n7. Don't try to compete with your children.\n\nNever boast about how much money you have accumulated. This sends a confusing message. Often children can't compete with their parents on this basis, and do not really want to. You don't have to boast of your achievements. Your children are wise enough to appreciate what you have accomplished. Never start a conversation with \"When I was your age, I already had...\" To many successful, achievement-oriented children of the affluent, accumulating money is not the superordinate goal. Instead, they want to be well educated, to be respected by their peers, and to occupy a high-status position. For many of these sons and daughters, the variations in income and wealth among occupations are much less important than they are for their parents. The typical first-generation affluent American is a business owner. He has a high net worth but often low self-esteem. The low-status, high-net worth parent often lives\u00a0 vicariously through his well-educated adult children who occupy high status professions. Ask a self-made millionaire a simple question: \"Mr. Ross, tell me about yourself.\" A prototypical multimillionaire (a high school dropout) recently answered this way: I was just a kid, a teenager, when we got married... never finished high school. But I started a business.... Today I'm very successful, got dozens of college graduates, my managers, working for me. By the way, did I mention that my daughter will graduate with honors from Barnard College? This same millionaire never wanted any of his children to be entrepreneurs. And, in reality, most of the children of the affluent never do become business owners. Money is second or third on their list of goals and achievements.\n\n8. Always remember that your children are individuals.\n\nThey differ from each other in motivation and achievement. Try as you may via economic outpatient care, inequalities will exist. Will economic outpatient care reduce these differences? It's unlikely. Subsidizing underachievers tends to enhance differences in wealth, not reduce them. This, in turn, can cause discord, since high-achieving brothers and sisters may resent such gift giving.\n\n9. Emphasize your children's achievements, no matter how small, not their or your symbols of success.\n\nTeach your children to achieve, not just to consume. Earning to enhance spending should not be one's ultimate goal. This is what Ken's father always taught him. Majoring in finance and marketing, Ken received an MBA with distinction. His father was a physician and a full-fledged member of the PAW group. He often told Ken: I am not impressed with what people own. But I'm impressed with what they achieve. I'm proud to be a physician. Always strive to be the best in your field.... Don't chase money. If you are the best in your field, money will find you.Ken's father lived by these beliefs. He lived well below his means and invested wisely. As Ken tells it: My dad bought a new Buick every eight years. He lived in the same house for thirty-two years. Simple house, nice house, less than an acre. Four bedrooms for six people, two bathrooms... one for Mom and Dad and the other shared by four children. What was it that Ken's father admired most about his son? First, that I worked part time as a busboy in a pancake restaurant throughout my high school years. Second, that I never asked him for money. He volunteered to lend me a few thousand dollars to start a business-right out of undergraduate school. Third, I sold the business with enough profits to fund my graduate school education completely . .. and never had to ask for a subsidy. Ken's focus today is on achievement. He is a key executive with a major communications and entertainment corporation. He is also an astute investor in both commercial real estate and quality public corporations. Also like his father, Ken is a prodigious accumulator of wealth. He lives in a modest home and drives used cars. His dad was a great role model and mentor to his son. But Ken also believes that his early experience as a busboy had a big influence on him: I got to see the masses... how the other people lived. I saw how hard people had to work to support their families . . . long, long hours at minimum wage just to get by. Money should not be wasted... no matter how much I earn.\n\n10. Tell your children that there are a lot of things more valuable than money.\n\nGood health, longevity, happiness, a loving family, selfreliance, fine friends . .. if you [have] five, you're a rich man. . . . Reputation, respect, integrity, honesty, and a history of achievements!\u00a0 Money [is] icing on the cake of life.... You don't ever have to cheat or steal . .. don't have to break the law . .. [or] cheat on your taxes. It's easier to make money honestly than [dishonestly] in this country. You will never exist in business if you rip people off! Life is the long run. You can't hide from adversity. You can't hide your children from life: Ups ups and downs. The ones who achieve do so by experiencing and conquering obstacles, . . . even from their childhood days. These are the ones who were never denied their right to face some struggle, some adversity. Others were, in reality, cheated. Those who attempted to shelter their children from every conceivable germ in our society . .. never really inoculated them from fear, worry, and the feeling of dependency. Not at all.\"",

    "Why We Sleep": [
        "\"Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep\n1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. As\n\ncreatures of habit, people have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns. Sleeping later on weekends won\u2019t fully make up for a lack of sleep during the week and will make it harder to wake up early on Monday morning. Set an alarm for bedtime. Often we set an alarm for when it\u2019s time to wake up but fail to do so for when it\u2019s time to go to sleep. If there is only one piece of advice you remember and take from these twelve tips, this should be it.\n\n2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime.\n\n3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Coffee, colas, certain teas, and chocolate contain the stimulant caffeine, and its effects can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully. Therefore, a cup of coffee in the late afternoon can make it hard for you to fall asleep at night. Nicotine is also a stimulant, often causing smokers to sleep only very lightly. In addition, smokers often wake up too early in the morning because of nicotine withdrawal.\n\n4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. Having a nightcap or alcoholic beverage before sleep may help you relax, but heavy use robs you of REM sleep, keeping you in the lighter stages of sleep. Heavy alcohol ingestion also may contribute to impairment in breathing at night. You also tend to wake up in the middle of the night when the effects of the alcohol have worn off.\n\n5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. A light snack is okay, but a large meal can cause indigestion, which interferes with sleep. Drinking too many fluids at night can cause frequent awakenings to urinate.\n\n6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep. Some commonly prescribed heart, blood pressure, or asthma medications, as well as some overthe-counter and herbal remedies for coughs, colds, or allergies, can disrupt sleep patterns. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your health care provider or pharmacist to see whether any drugs you\u2019re taking might be contributing to your insomnia and ask whether they can be taken at other times during the day or early in the evening.\n\n7. Don\u2019t take naps after 3 p.m. Naps can help make up for lost sleep, but late afternoon naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night.\n\n8. Relax before bed. Don\u2019t overschedule your day so that no time is left for unwinding. A relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.\n\n9. Take a hot bath before bed. The drop in body temperature after getting out of the bath may help you feel sleepy, and the bath can help you relax and slow down so you\u2019re more ready to sleep.\n\n10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom. Get rid of anything in your bedroom that might distract you from sleep, such as noises, bright lights, an uncomfortable bed, or warm temperatures. You sleep better if the temperature in the room is kept on the cool side. A TV, cell phone, or computer in the bedroom can be a distraction and deprive you of needed sleep. Having a comfortable mattress and pillow can help promote a good night\u2019s sleep. Individuals who have insomnia often watch the clock. Turn the clock\u2019s face out of view so you don\u2019t worry about the time while trying to fall asleep.\n\n11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Daylight is key to regulating daily sleep patterns. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day. If possible, wake up with the sun or use very bright lights in the morning. Sleep experts recommend that, if you have problems falling asleep, you should get an hour of exposure to morning sunlight and turn down the lights before bedtime.\n\n12. Don\u2019t lie in bed awake. If you find yourself still awake after staying in bed for more than twenty minutes or if you are starting to feel anxious or worried, get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. The anxiety of not being able to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep.\"",

But like calorie recommendations, it\u2019s a good target for the average human being. Most of us set ambient house and/or bedroom temperatures higher than are optimal for good sleep and this likely contributes to lower quantity and/or quality of sleep than you are otherwise capable of getting. Lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.5\u00b0C) can be harmful rather than helpful to sleep, unless warm bedding or nightclothes are used. However, most of us fall into the opposite category of setting a controlled bedroom temperature that is too high: 70 or 72 degrees.

        "\"One of the largest booms and busts of the late twentieth century involved the Japanese real estate and stock markets.\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the value of Japanese real estate increased more than 75 times. By 1990, the total value of all Japanese property was estimated at nearly $20 trillion\u2014equal to more than 20 percent of the entire world\u2019s wealth and about double the total value of the world\u2019s stock markets. America is twenty-five times bigger than Japan in terms of physical acreage, and yet Japan\u2019s property in 1990 was appraised to be worth five times as much as all American property. Theoretically, the Japanese could have bought all the property in America by selling off metropolitan Tokyo. Just selling the Imperial Palace and its grounds at their appraised value would have raised enough cash to buy all of California. The stock market countered by rising like a helium balloon on a windless day. Stock prices increased 100-fold from 1955 to 1990. At their peak, in December 1989, Japanese stocks had a total market value of about $4 trillion, almost 1.5 times the value of all U.S. equities and close to 45 percent of the world\u2019s equitymarket capitalization. Firm-foundation investors were aghast that Japanese stocks sold at more than 60 times earnings, almost 5 times book value, and more than 200 times dividends. In contrast, U.S. stocks sold at about 15 times earnings, and London equities sold at 12 times earnings. The value of NTT Corporation, Japan\u2019s telephone giant, exceeded the value of AT&T, IBM, Exxon, General Electric, and General Motors put together. Supporters of the stock market had answers to all the logical objections that could be raised. Were price-earnings ratios in the stratosphere? \u201cNo,\u201d said the salespeople at Kabuto-cho (Japan\u2019s Wall Street). \u201cJapanese earnings are understated relative to U.S. earnings because depreciation charges are overstated and earnings do not include the earnings of partially owned affiliated firms.\u201d Price-earnings multiples adjusted for these effects would be much lower. Were yields, at well under \u00bd of 1 percent, unconscionably low? The answer was that this simply reflected the low interest rates at the time in Japan. Was it dangerous that stock prices were five times the value of assets? Not at all. The book values did not reflect the dramatic appreciation of the land owned by Japanese companies. And the high value of Japanese land was \u201cexplained\u201d by both the density of Japanese population and the various regulations and tax laws restricting the use of habitable land. In fact, none of the \u201cexplanations\u201d could hold water. Even when earnings were adjusted, the multiples were still far higher than in other countries and extraordinarily inflated relative to Japan\u2019s own history. Moreover, Japanese profitability had been declining, and the strong yen was bound to make it more difficult for Japan to export. Although land was scarce in Japan, its manufacturers, such as its auto makers, were finding abundant land for new plants at attractive prices in foreign lands. And rental income had been rising far more slowly than land values, indicating a falling rate of return on real estate. Finally, the low interest rates that had been underpinning the market had already begun to rise in 1989. Much to the distress of those speculators who had concluded that the fundamental laws of financial gravity were not applicable to Japan, Isaac Newton arrived there in 1990. Interestingly, it was the government itself that dropped the apple. The Bank of Japan (Japan\u2019s Federal Reserve) saw the ugly specter of a general inflation stirring amid the borrowing frenzy and the liquidity boom underwriting the rise in land and stock prices. And so the central bank restricted credit and engineered a rise in interest rates. The hope was that further rises in property prices would be choked off and the stock market might be eased downward. The stock market was not eased down; instead, it collapsed. The fall was almost as extreme as the U.S. stock-market crash from the end of 1929 to mid-1932. The Japanese (Nikkei) stock-market index reached a high of almost 40,000 on the last trading day of the 1980s. By mid-August 1992, the index had declined to 14,309, a drop of about 63 percent. The fall in stock prices from 1990 on simply reflected a return to the price-to-book-value relationships that were typical in the early 1980s. The Japanese stock market remained depressed for the next several decades. In March of 2018, the Nikkei index sold at 21,000. The air also rushed out of the real estate balloon during the early 1990s. Various measures of land prices and property values indicate a decline roughly as severe as that of the stock market. The financial laws of gravity know no geographic boundaries.\"",

If Cisco grew its earnings at 15 percent per year, it would still be selling at a well above average multiple ten years later. And if Cisco returned 15 percent per year for the next twenty-five years and the national economy continued to grow at 5 percent over the same period, Cisco would have been bigger than the entire economy.

        "\"IS THERE MOMENTUM IN THE STOCK MARKET?\nThe technician believes that knowledge of a stock\u2019s past behavior can help predict its probable future behavior. In other words, the sequence of price changes before any given day is important in predicting the price change for that day. This might be called \u201cthe wallpaper principle.\u201d The technical analyst tries to predict future stock prices just as we might predict that the pattern of wallpaper behind the mirror is the same as the pattern above the mirror. The basic premise is that there are repeatable patterns in space and time.\n\nChartists believe momentum exists in the market. Supposedly, stocks that have been rising will continue to do so, and those that begin falling will go on sinking. Investors should therefore buy stocks that start rising and continue to hold their strong stocks. Should the stock begin to fall, investors are advised to sell.\n\nThese technical rules have been tested exhaustively by using stock-price data as far back as the beginning of the twentieth century. The results reveal that past movements in stock prices cannot be used reliably to foretell future movements. The stock market has little, if any, memory. While the market does exhibit some momentum, it does not occur dependably, and there are frequent momentum crashes. There is not enough persistence in stock prices to make trend-following strategies consistently profitable. Although there is some short-term momentum in the stock market, as will be described more fully in chapter 11, any investor who pays transactions costs and taxes is unlikely to benefit from it.\n\nEconomists have also examined the technician\u2019s thesis that there are often sequences of price changes in the same direction over several days (or several weeks or months). Stocks are likened to fullbacks who, once having gained some momentum, can be expected to carry on for a long gain. It turns out that this is simply not the case. Sometimes one gets positive price changes (rising prices) for several days in a row; but sometimes when you are flipping a fair coin you also get a long string of \u201cheads\u201d in a row, and you get sequences of positive (or negative) price changes no more frequently than you can expect random sequences of heads or tails in a row.

        "\"Index funds now account for more than 40 percent of the total invested in mutual funds and ETFs. So active managers responded with a new criticism. It is now alleged that index funds pose a grave danger both to the stock market and to the general economy\nOne of the most respected research houses on Wall Street, Sanford C. Bernstein, published a 47-page report in 2016 with the provocative title, The Silent Road to Serfdom: Why Passive Investing is Worse than Marxism. The report argued that a capitalist market system in which investors invest passively in index funds is even worse than a centrally planned economy, where government directs all capital investment. Indexing is alleged to cause money to pour into a set of investments independent of considerations such as profitability and growth opportunities. It is active managers who ensure that new information is properly reflected in stock prices. Indexing is also accused of producing a concentration of ownership not seen since the days of the Rockefeller Trust. Could it be possible that if everyone invested only in index funds, indexing could grow in the future to such a size that stocks could become massively mispriced? If everybody indexed, who would ensure that stock prices reflect all the information available about the prospects for different companies? Who would trade from stock to stock to ensure that the market was efficient? The paradox of index investing is that the stock market needs some active traders who analyze and act on new information so that stocks are efficiently priced and sufficiently liquid for investors to be able to buy and sell. Active traders play a positive role in determining security prices and how capital is allocated. This is the main logical pillar on which the efficient-market theory rests. If the spread of news is unimpeded, prices will react quickly so that they reflect all that is known. The paradox is that the very activity of active investors makes it highly unlikely that unexploited opportunities for abnormal profits can continue to exist. I have recounted the story of the finance professor and his students who spotted a $100 bill lying on the street. \u201cIf it was really a $100 bill,\u201d the professor reasoned out loud, \u201csomeone would have already picked it up.\u201d Fortunately, the students were skeptical, not only of Wall Street professionals but also of learned professors, and so they picked up the money. Clearly, there is considerable logic to the finance professor\u2019s position. In markets where intelligent people are searching for value, it is unlikely that people will perpetually leave $100 bills around ready for the taking. But history tells us that unexploited opportunities do exist from time to time, as do periods of speculative excess pricing. We know of Dutchmen paying astronomical prices for tulip bulbs, of Englishmen splurging on the most improbable bubbles, and of modern institutional fund managers who convinced themselves that some Internet stocks were so unlike any other that any price was reasonable. And when investors were overcome with pessimism, real fundamental investment opportunities such as closed-end funds were passed by. Yet eventually, excessive valuations were corrected and investors did snatch up the bargain closed-end funds. Perhaps the finance professor\u2019s advice should have been, \u201cYou had better pick up that $100 bill quickly because if it\u2019s really there, someone else will surely take it.\u201d\n\nActive managers are incentivized to perform this function by charging substantial management fees. They will continue to market their services with the claim that they have above-average insights that enable them to beat the market even though, unlike in Garrison Keillor\u2019s mythical Lake Wobegon, they cannot all achieve above-average market returns. And even if the proportion of active managers shrinks to as little as 10 or 5 percent of the total, there would still be more than enough of them to make prices reflect information. We have far too much active management today, not too little. But as a thought experiment, suppose everybody did index and individual stocks did not reflect new information? Suppose a drug company develops a new cancer drug that promises to double the company\u2019s sales and earnings, but the price of its shares does not increase to reflect the news. In our capitalist system it is inconceivable that some trader or hedge fund would not emerge to bid up the price of the stock and profit from the mispricing. In a free-market system we can expect that advantageous arbitrage opportunities are exploited by profit-seeking market participants no matter how many investors index. The facts indicate that the percentage of active managers outperformed by the index has increased over time. If anything, the stock market is becoming more efficient\u2014not less so\u2014despite the growth of indexing.\n\nTo be sure, index investors are free riders. They do receive the benefits that result from active trading without bearing the costs. But free riding on price signals provided by others is hardly a flaw of the capitalist system; it is an essential feature of that system. In a free-market economy we all benefit from relying on a set of market prices that are determined by others.\n\nIt is true that as indexing continues to grow, there may well be a growing concentration of ownership among the index-providers, and they will have increased influence in proxy voting. They must use their votes to ensure that companies act in the best interests of shareholders. In my own experience as a longtime director of Vanguard Group\u2014the pioneers and leaders of the index fund revolution, with over $5 trillion under management\u2014there was never an instance where a vote was made that would encourage anticompetitive behavior. I know of no examples where index funds have used their votes to collude in an attempt to cartelize any industry. There is simply no evidence that anticompetitive practices have actually been encouraged by giants such as Blackstone, Vanguard, and State Street because of their common ownership of all the major companies in an industry. Nor would it be in their interest to do so. The same investment companies control a sizeable portion of the common stock of every major company in the market. Perhaps banding together to encourage the airline companies to raise their prices would benefit their holdings of airline stocks. But this would mean higher costs for all the other companies in their portfolio that depend on the airlines to facilitate business travel. Index funds have no incentive to favor one industry over another. Indeed, since index funds have encouraged managements to adopt compensation systems based on relative rather than absolute performance, they have explicitly promoted vigorous competition among the firms in every industry. Index funds have been of enormous benefit for individual investors. Competition has driven the cost of broad-based index funds essentially to zero. Individuals can now save for retirement far more efficiently than before. Indexing has transformed the investing experience of millions of investors. It has helped them save for retirement and meet their other investment goals by providing efficient instruments that can be used to build diversified portfolios.\"",

        "\"The persistence of this belief in repetitive stock-market patterns is due to statistical illusion.\nTo illustrate, let me describe an experiment in which I asked my students to participate.

        "\"Dollar-Cost Averaging Can Reduce the Risks of Investing in Stocks and Bonds\nIf, like most people, you will be building up your investment portfolio slowly over time with the accretion of yearly savings, you will be taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. This technique is controversial, but it does help you avoid the risk of putting all your money in the stock or bond market at the wrong time. Don\u2019t be alarmed by the fancy-sounding name. Dollar-cost averaging simply means investing the same fixed amount of money in, for example, the shares of some index mutual fund, at regular intervals\u2014say, every month or quarter\u2014over a long period of time. Periodic investments of equal dollar amounts in common stocks can reduce (but not avoid) the risks of equity investment by ensuring that the entire portfolio of stocks will not be purchased at temporarily inflated prices.\n\nDollar-cost averaging is not a panacea that eliminates the risk of investing in common stocks. It will not save your 401(k) plan from a devastating fall in value during a year such as 2008, because no plan can protect you from a punishing bear market. And you must have both the cash and the confidence to continue making the periodic investments even when the sky is the darkest. No matter how scary the financial news, no matter how difficult it is to see any signs of optimism, you must not interrupt the automatic-pilot nature of the program. Because if you do, you will lose the benefit of buying at least some of your shares after a sharp market decline when they are for sale at low prices. Dollar-cost averaging will give you this bargain: Your average price per share will be lower than the average price at which you bought shares. Why? Because you\u2019ll buy more shares at low prices and fewer at high prices. Some investment advisers are not fans of dollar-cost averaging, because the strategy is not optimal if the market does go straight up. (You would have been better off putting all $5,000 into the market at the beginning of the period.) But it does provide a reasonable insurance policy against poor future stock markets. And it does minimize the regret that inevitably follows if you were unlucky enough to have put all your money into the stock market during a peak period such as March of 2000 or October of 2007. To further illustrate the benefits of dollar-cost averaging, let\u2019s move from a hypothetical to a real example. The following table shows the results (ignoring taxes) of a $500 initial investment made on January 1, 1978, and thereafter $100 per month, in the shares of the Vanguard 500 Index mutual fund. Less than $49,000 was committed to the program. The final value was over $760,000\"",

Each year, they reaped the rewards of investing: all the earnings growth that those thousands of corporations generated and all the dividends that they distributed. 4 Each family member grew wealthier at the same pace, and all was harmonious.

These Helpers convince the cousins to sell some of their shares in the companies to other family members and to buy some shares of others from them in return. The Helpers handle the transactions, and as brokers, they receive commissions for their services. The ownership is thus rearranged among the family members. To their surprise, however, the family wealth begins to grow at a slower pace. Why?

To make matters worse, while the family had always paid taxes on their dividends, some of the members are now also paying taxes on the capital gains they realize from their stock-swapping back and forth, further diminishing the family\u2019s total wealth. The smart cousins quickly realize that their plan has actually diminished the rate of growth in the family\u2019s wealth.

These include:\n\n\u2022 A face, manner, way of talking and moving that project the pleasure one takes in\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 being alive.\n\n\u2022 Ease in talking of accomplishments or shortcomings with directness and honesty,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 since one is in friendly relationship to facts.\n\n\u2022 Comfort in giving and receiving compliments, expressions of\n\u00a0 \u00a0 affection,appreciation, and the like.\n\u2022 Open to criticism and comfortable about acknowledging mistakes because one's\n\u00a0 self-esteem is not tied to an image of \"perfection.\"\n\n\u2022 One's words and movements tend to have a quality of ease and spontaneity since\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 one is not at war with oneself.\n\u2022 Harmony between what one says and does and how one looks, sounds and\n\u00a0 \u00a0 moves.\n\n\u2022 An attitude of openness to and curiosity about new ideas, new experiences, new\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 possibilities of life.\n\n\u2022 Feelings of anxiety or insecurity, if they present themselves, will be less likely to\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 intimidate or overwhelm one, since accepting them, managing them and rising\n\u00a0 \u00a0 above them rarely feels impossibly difficult.\n\u2022 An ability to enjoy the humorous aspects of life, in oneself and others.\n\u2022 Flexible in responding to situations and challenges, moved by a spirit of\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 inventiveness and even playfulness, since one trusts one's mind and does not see\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 life as doom or defeat.\n\u2022 Comfort with assertive (not belligerent) behavior in oneself and others.\n\n\u2022 Ability to preserve a quality of harmony and dignity under conditions of stress.\n\nThen, on the purely physical level, one can observe characteristics such as these:\n\n\u2022 Eyes that are alert, bright, and lively.\n\n\u2022 A face that is relaxed and (barring illness) tends to exhibit natural\u00a0 color and good\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 skin vibrancy.\n\n\u2022 A chin that is held naturally and in alignment with one's body.\n\u2022 A relaxed jaw.\n\u2022 Shoulders relaxed yet erect.\n\u2022 Hands that tend to be relaxed, graceful, and quiet.\n\u2022 Arms tend to hang in a relaxed, natural way.\n\u2022 Posture tends to be relaxed, erect, well-balanced.\n\n\u2022 A walk that tends to be purposeful (without being aggressive and overbearing).\n\n\u2022 Voice tends to be modulated with an intensity appropriate to\n\u00a0 \u00a0 the situation, and with clear pronunciation.\"",
        "\"Let us remember that self-esteem pertains to that which is open to our volitional choice.\nIt cannot properly be a function of the family we were born into, or our race, or the color of our skin, or the achievements of our ancestors. These are values people sometimes cling to in order to avoid responsibility for achieving authentic self-esteem. They are sources of what, I call \"pseudo-self-esteem.\" They are not substitutes for consciousness, responsibility, or integrity. They are not sources of selfefficacy and self-respect. They can, however, become sources of self-delusion.\""

It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.\u201d\n- \u201cOne can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them.\u201d\n- \u201cIf we want to make friends, let\u2019s put ourselves out to do things for other people\u2014things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.\u201d\n- Greet people with animation and enthusiasm.\n- \u201cA show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention.\u201d\n\n**Principle 2: Smile.**\n\n- The expression on your face is more important than the clothes you wear on your back.\n- A smile communicates: \u201cI like you, You make me happy. I am glad to see you.\u201d\n- \u201cYou must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.\u201d\n- Shakespeare: \u201cThere is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d\n- \u201cYour smile is a messenger of good will.\u201d\n\n**Principle 3: Remember that a person\u2019s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.**\n\n- \u201cThe average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together.\u201d\n- Remembering a person\u2019s name and using it in conversation is a powerful but subtle compliment.\n- \u201cMost people don\u2019t remember names, for the simple reason that they don\u2019t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are too busy.\u201d\n\nTechnique for remembering names:\n\n    - If you do not hear the name clearly, ask for it to be repeated.\n    - If the name is particularly challenging, ask for it to be spelled.\n    - Repeat the name several times during a conversation.\n- \u201cThe name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others.\u201d\n\n**Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.**\n\n- \u201cVery important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait.\u201d\n- \u201cIf you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don\u2019t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.\u201d\n- \u201cPeople who talk only of themselves think only of themselves.\u201d\n- In order to be a good conversationalist, you must be an attentive listener.\n- \u201cThe people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.\u201d\n\n**Principle 5: Talk in terms of the other person\u2019s interests.**\n\n- Guest of Theodore Roosevelt were astonished at his range of knowledge. But he had a secret trick he used: \u201cWhenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested. For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person\u2019s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.\u201d\n\n**Principle 6: Make the other person feel important\u2014and do it sincerely.**\n\n- In order to say something kind about another person, observe and ask yourself: \u201cWhat is there about this person that I can honestly admire?\u201d\n- Strive to radiate happiness and \u201cpass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return\u2026\u201d\n- William James: \u201cThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\u201d\n\nSimple phrases that convey respect and politeness:\n\n    - \u201cI\u2019m sorry to trouble you\u2026\u201d\n    - \u201cWould you be so kind as to\u2026\u201d\n    - \u201cWould you mind?\u201d\n- \u201cAll the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you realize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.\u201d \"",

Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn\u2019t ask for your opinion. He didn\u2019t want it.

Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\u201d\n- \u201cNine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.\u201d\n- \u201cYou can\u2019t win an argument.

You can seldom have both.\u201d\n- \u201cA misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person\u2019s viewpoint.\u201d\n- Suggestions for keeping a disagreement from escalating:\n    - Welcome the disagreement.\n    - Distrust your first instinctive impression.\n    - Control your temper.\n    - Listen first.\n    - Look for areas of agreement.\n    - Be honest.\n    - Promise to think over your opponent\u2019s ideas.\n    - Thank your opponents for their interest.\n    - Postpone action to think through the problem.\n\n**Principle 2: Show respect for the other person\u2019s opinions.

And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our oesophagus.\u201d\n- Benjamin Franklin: \u2018I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiment of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix\u2019d opinion, such as \u201ccertainly,\u201d \u201cundoubtedly,\u201d etc., and I adopted, instead of them, \u201cI conceive,\u201d \u201cI apprehend,\u201d or \u201cI imagine\u201d a thing to be so or so, or \u201cit so appears to me at present.\u201d\n\n**Principle 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.**\n\n- \u201cIf we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn\u2019t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn\u2019t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?\u201d\n- \u201cThere is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one\u2019s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the error.\u201d\n- \u201cWhen we are right, let\u2019s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong \u2013 and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves \u2013 let\u2019s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.\u201d\n- Proverb: By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\n\n**Principle 4: Begin in a friendly way.**\n\n- Lincoln: \u201cIt is an old and true maxim that \u2018a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\u2019 So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.\u201d\n- Friendliness begets friendliness.\n\n**Principle 5: Get the other person saying \u2018yes, yes\u2019 immediately.**\n\n- Emphasize the things with which you agree and defer considering the areas in which you differ.\n- Emphasize that both parties want the same goal and that any difference is one of methodology rather than purpose.\n- \u201cA \u2018No\u2019 response\u2026is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said \u2018No,\u2019 all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the \u2018No\u2019 was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it.\u201d\n- Look to the Socratic method: \u201cHis whole technique\u2026was based upon getting a \u2018yes, yes\u2019 response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree\u2026until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.\u201d\n\n**Principle 6: Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.**\n\n- \u201cMost people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves.\u201d\n- La Rouchefoucauld: If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.\n- Talk less and listen more.\n\n**Principle 7: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.**\n\n- \u201cNo one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.\u201d\n- For businesses one important lesson is to get feedback from your customers on how best to solve their problem.\n- Results are more important than getting credit for an idea.\n- Lao-Tze: \u2018The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, puts himself below them; wishing to be before them, he puts himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.\u2019\n\n**Principle 8: Try honestly to see things from the other person\u2019s point of view.**\n\n- \u201cThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason \u2013 and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.\u201d\n- Gerald Nirenberg: \u201cCooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person\u2019s ideas and feelings as important as your own.\u201d\n\n**Principle 9: Be sympathetic with the other person\u2019s ideas and desires.**\n\n- Dale Carnegie\u2019s \u201cmagic phrase\u201d for stopping arguments and creating good will: \u201cI don\u2019t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\u201d\n- \u201cThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.\u201d\n\n**Principle 10: Appeal to the nobler motives.**\n\n- \u201cAll people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.\u201d\n- \u201cA person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.\u201d\n- One strategy for changing or influencing others is to appeal to their nobler motives. Make an appeal to the person\u2019s sense of honesty, fairness, integrity and sincerity.\n\n**Principle 11: Dramatize your ideas.**\n\n- \u201cMerely stating a truth isn\u2019t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic.\u201d\n- This idea is necessary in order to earn attention and stand above your peers and competitors.\n\n**Principle 12: Throw down a challenge.**\n\n- Charles Schwab: \u201cThe way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.\u201d\n- Interesting, stimulating and exciting work is, in itself, a kind of motivation for people: it makes them look forward to the challenge.\n- The desire to excel instills a feeling of importance in people and feeling important is one of the greatest universal desires.\"",

        "\"Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\n**Principle 1: Don\u2019t criticize, condemn or complain.**\n\n- \u201cCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.\u201d\n\nDangers of criticism:\n\n    - Wounds a person\u2019s pride.\n    - Injures the person\u2019s sense of importance.\n    - Generates resentment.\n- Hans Selye: \"People thirst for approval and dread condemnation.\"\n- Consider the repercussions when you aim to criticize: Does the gain (relieving your feelings) justify the cost (hard feelings, resentment and resignation from the recipient)?\n- Instead of trying to change others, first work to change and improve yourself. It is more profitable and less dangerous.\n- \u201cWhen dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.\u201d\n- Carlyle: \u201cA great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.\u201d\n- Try to understand the point of view of the other person in order to foster sympathy, tolerance and kindness.\n\n**Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.**\n\n- The only way to get someone do to something is to make the person want to do it.\n- Delivering something a person wants is an effective strategy.\n- John Dewey: The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.\n\nCommon wants:\n\n    - Health and preservation of life.\n    - Food and sleep.\n    - Money and the things money buys.\n    - Life in the hereafter.\n    - Sexual gratification.\n    - Well-being for our children.\n    - A feeling of importance.\n- \u201cWe nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem?\u201d\n- Appreciation is sincere; flattery is not.\n- \u201cFlattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.\u201d\n- We spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about ourselves.\n- Expressions of appreciation should be given both to family and friends as well as to people who help, service or inform us in our daily lives.\n- \u201cTry leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.\u201d\n- Make an effort to identify and verbalize the good points in others.\n\n**Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.**\n\n- \u201cThe only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.\u201d\n- Henry Ford: \u201cIf there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person\u2019s point of view and see things from that person\u2019s angle as well as from your own.\u201d\n- Advice to sales people: Offer and demonstrate how your product can solve other people\u2019s problems.\n- \u201cThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.\u201d \"",
        "\"Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment\n**Principle 1: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.**\n\n- \u201cIt is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.\u201d\n- \u201cBeginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing.\u201d\n\n**Principle 2: Call attention to people\u2019s mistakes indirectly.**\n\n- Consider eliminating the word \u201cbut\u201d: \u201cMany people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word \u2018but\u2019 and ending with a critical statement.\u201d The part after the \u201cbut\u201d makes people question the sincerity of the initial praise.\n\nChange the word \u201cbut\u201d to \u201cand.\u201d The result is no inference of failure in the second part of the statement.\n\n    - Example with \u201cbut\u201d: \u2018We\u2019re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.\u2019\n    - Example with \u201cand\u201d: \u2018We\u2019re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.\u2019\n- \u201cCalling attention to one\u2019s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism.\u201d\n\n**Principle 3: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.**\n\n- \u201cIt isn\u2019t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.\u201d\n\n**Principle 4: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**\n\n- Asking questions gives others a chance to figure out how to do things themselves and gives them ownership and a sense of importance over the task.\n- \u201cAsking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.\u201d\n\n**Principle 5: Let the other person save face.**\n\n- \u201cWe ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person\u2019s pride. Whereas a few minutes\u2019 thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person\u2019s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!\u201d\n- \u201cEven if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face.\u201d\n- Antoine de Saint-Exupery: I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.\n\n**Principle 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be \u2018hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\u2019**\n\n- \u201cYou who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire them with a realization of their latent possibilities.\u201d\n- \u201cAbilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.\u201d\n- Be specific in your praise: \u201cEverybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere \u2013 not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.\u201d\n\n**Principle 7: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.**\n\n- \u201cIf you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.\u201d\n\n**Principle 8: Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.**\n\n- Emphasize the positive and be careful not to discourage through too much focus on mistakes and errors.\n- The goal is to foster a desire to improve rather than foster a desire to quit.\n- \u201cBe liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it \u2013 and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.\u201d\n\n**Principle 9: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.**\n\n- Making the person feel important is key.\n- When asking someone to perform a task that might seem undesirable, be sure to consider and articulate the benefits that align with the person\u2019s wants.\n- \u201cIt is na\u00efve to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these approaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than by not using these principles \u2013 and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before \u2013 and that is your benefit.\u201d \"",

        "Dealing with Overfitting\nOverfitting\n\nGet more data\t\nHaving more data gives the model more opportunities to learn patterns, patterns which may be more generalizable to new examples.\n\nSimplify your model\t\nIf the current model is already overfitting the training data, it may be too complicated of a model. This means it's learning the patterns of the data too well and isn't able to generalize well to unseen data. One way to simplify a model is to reduce the number of layers it uses or to reduce the number of hidden units in each layer.\n\nUse data augmentation\t\nData augmentation manipulates the training data in a way so that's harder for the model to learn as it artificially adds more variety to the data. If a model is able to learn patterns in augmented data, the model may be able to generalize better to unseen data.\n\nUse transfer learning\t\nTransfer learning involves leveraging the patterns (also called pretrained weights) one model has learned to use as the foundation for your own task. In our case, we could use one computer vision model pretrained on a large variety of images and then tweak it slightly to be more specialized for food images.\n\nUse dropout layers\t\nDropout layers randomly remove connections between hidden layers in neural networks, effectively simplifying a model but also making the remaining connections better. See torch.nn.Dropout() for more.\n\nUse learning rate decay\t\nThe idea here is to slowly decrease the learning rate as a model trains. This is akin to reaching for a coin at the back of a couch. The closer you get, the smaller your steps. The same with the learning rate, the closer you get to convergence, the smaller you'll want your weight updates to be.\n\nUse early stopping\t\nEarly stopping stops model training before it begins to overfit. As in, say the model's loss has stopped decreasing for the past 10 epochs (this number is arbitrary), you may want to stop the model training here and go with the model weights that had the lowest loss (10 epochs prior).\nThere are more methods for dealing with overfitting but these are some of the main ones.",

One way to add more predictive power to your model is to increase the number of hidden layers/units within those layers.\n\nTweak the learning rate\tPerhaps your model's learning rate is too high to begin with. And it's trying to update its weights each epoch too much, in turn not learning anything. In this case, you might lower the learning rate and see what happens.\n\nUse transfer learning\t\nTransfer learning is capable of preventing overfitting and underfitting. It involves using the patterns from a previously working model and adjusting them to your own problem.\n\nTrain for longer\t\nSometimes a model just needs more time to learn representations of data. If you find in your smaller experiments your model isn't learning anything, perhaps leaving it train for a more epochs may result in better performance.\n\nUse less regularization\t\nPerhaps your model is underfitting because you're trying to prevent overfitting too much. Holding back on regularization techniques can help your model fit the data better.",

        "\"The Bitter Lesson\nThe biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.  There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.\n\nIn computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in 1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler, search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective, these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said that  \"brute force\" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not.\n\nA similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning by self play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research. In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only much later was much greater success had by embracing search and learning.\n\nIn speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge",

Ambition whets your appetite for success, and that hunger propels you ahead.\n\n**Organization building**\n\nYou cannot achieve huge goals single-handedly. You need an organization for that. You need a group of experts.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nI have encountered many challenges and situations in my professional life that made me feel weak inwardly. I was often overcome with fear of losing the battle. Nevertheless, I never gave up. I have unflinching commitment to my objectives, regardless of the challenges I face. If one project does not work out, I am always prepared to switch to the next one to achieve my goals.\n\n**Market astuteness**\n\nBusiness does not run on the lines of elaborate theories outlined in thick books. Books may be helpful in generating business experts, but not businesspersons. One becomes a businessperson through market awareness\n\n**Conservatism brings benefits**\n\nConsider the positive aspects before getting into a project but, once you embark on it, you should focus on the negative aspects such as the challenges to be faced and the likely response of competitors. Identify the possible or imminent problems to duly address them. Start to mull over contingency plans. If you do not have contingency plans, then you might end up losing what you already have.\n\n**Restlessness ruins negotiation**\n\nThe more you appear restless at the negotiating table, the more you lose. The person in front of you tries his best to corner you. A deal hinges a lot on how you talk and how you present yourself. I give the highest priority to my terms, my competence and my stake when I negotiate. For instance, when I am seeking fifty points, I will start asking for 100. In most cases, I succeed in striking a deal at seventy-five. Also, since everybody wants the best deal in\n\nnegotiations, you can get a better deal if you can create a win-win situation for both sides. Making unnecessary demands can\u00a0 lead to failed negotiations.\n\n**Nothing succeeds like success**\n\nAs the saying goes, nothing succeeds like success. If you become successful in any venture, more successes will follow. You have to create a strong success story for the world to see if you want to establish yourself in business. You should create a persona that persuades others to trust you. However, if you try your hand at a new venture before your earlier business is established, you will not make your mark in the market. Try to look for a complementary sector when you are ready for a new venture. Put in a lot of extra effort if you venture into a field in which you do not have sufficient experience.\n\n**Costs must be pruned**\nWork quietly and cost effectively.\n\n**Discipline**\n\nDiscipline is about two things: personal conduct and time management. How do you conduct yourself with your colleagues? How do you present yourself before your partners, sales agents and buyers? These things determine your personal discipline. Talking idly with everyone you come across will diminish your stature. You need to strike a balance between respect, affection and fear when it comes to your relationship with your employees. Time is the most precious thing in this world. You cannot get it back when it is gone, regardless of how much you are willing to pay. Do not forget that life is not just about business. We also have family and friends, and personal and social lives. You have to optimize the time you have allotted to your professional life to your maximum benefit so that you still have time left over for other things in life. If you cannot handle the most precious thing in the world with care, you may not be able to handle other matters either.\n\n**Keep yourself updated**\n\nSelf-learning is important. Learn from observing others. Mingle with a lot of people. Make new friends wherever you go. Listen to them attentively. Study them carefully. Learn their tricks. They are a business school. Those who are happy limiting themselves to a narrow sphere cannot be big-timers. It is really important to keep yourself updated and stay abreast of what is going on around you. The more you are in step with the world outside, the more your personality shines. Always strive to overcome your weaknesses so that you can grow as a person. Never shy away from learning things you do not know anything about. Be am an avid reader. Try to collect information on many subjects that I feel may come in handy at some point.\"\n\n**\n**",

        "\"The Final Checklist \"\n**STOCKS IN GENERAL**\n\n\u2022 The p/e ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company and for similar companies in the same industry.\n\n\u2022 The percentage of institutional ownership. The lower the better.\n\n\u2022 Whether insiders are buying and whether the company itself is buying back its own shares. Both are positive signs.\n\n\u2022 The record of earnings growth to date and whether the earnings are sporadic or consistent. (The only category where earnings may not be important is in the asset play.)\n\n\u2022 Whether the company has a strong balance sheet or a weak balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio) and how it\u2019s rated for financial strength.\n\n\u2022 The cash position. With $16 in net cash, I know Ford is unlikely to drop below $16 a share. That\u2019s the floor on the stock.\n\n**SLOW GROWERS**\n\n\u2022 Since you buy these for the dividends (why else would you own them?) you want to check to see if dividends have always been paid, and whether they are routinely raised.\n\n\u2022 When possible, find out what percentage of the earnings are being paid out as dividends. If it\u2019s a low percentage, then the company has a cushion in hard times. It can earn less money and still retain the dividend. If it\u2019s a high percentage, then the dividend is riskier.\n\n**STALWARTS**\n\n\u2022 These are big companies that aren\u2019t likely to go out of business. The key issue is price, and the p/e ratio will tell you whether you are paying too much.\n\n\u2022 Check for possible diworseifications that may reduce earnings in the future.\n\n\u2022 Check the company\u2019s long-term growth rate, and whether it has kept up the same momentum in recent years.\n\n\u2022 If you plan to hold the stock forever, see how the company has fared during previous recessions and market drops. (McDonald\u2019s did well in the 1977 break, and in the 1984 break it went sideways. In the big Sneeze of 1987, it got blown away with the rest. Overall it\u2019s been a good defensive stock. Bristol-Myers got clobbered in the 1973\u201374 break, primarily because it was so overpriced. It did well in 1982, 1984, and 1987. Kellogg has survived all the recent debacles, except for \u201973\u2013\u201974, in relatively healthy fashion.)\n\n**CYCLICALS**\n\n\u2022 Keep a close watch on inventories, and the supply-demand relationship. Watch for new entrants into the market, which is usually a dangerous development.\n\n\u2022 Anticipate a shrinking p/e multiple over time as business recovers and investors look ahead to the end of the cycle, when peak earnings are achieved.\n\n\u2022 If you know your cyclical, you have an advantage in figuring out the cycles. (For instance, everyone knows there are cycles in the auto industry. Eventually there are going to be three or four up years to follow three or four down years. There always are. Cars get older and they have to be replaced. People can put off replacing cars for a year or two longer than expected, but sooner or later they are back in the dealerships. But it\u2019s much easier to predict an upturn in a cyclical industry than it is to predict a downturn.)\n\n**FAST GROWERS**\n\n\u2022 Investigate whether the product that\u2019s supposed to enrich the company is a major part of the company\u2019s business. It was with L\u2019eggs, but not with Lexan.\n\n\u2022 What the growth rate in earnings has been in recent years. (My favorites are the ones in the 20 to 25 percent range. I\u2019m wary of companies that seem to be growing faster than 25 percent. Those 50 percenters usually are found in hot industries, and you know what that means.)\n\n\u2022 That the company has duplicated its successes in more than one city or town, to prove that expansion will work.\n\n\u2022 That the company still has room to grow. When I first visited Pic \u2019N\u2019 Save, they were established in southern California and were just beginning to talk about expanding into northern California. There were forty-nine other states to go. Sears, on the other hand, is everywhere.\n\n\u2022 Whether the stock is selling at a p/e ratio at or near the growth rate.\n\n\u2022 Whether the expansion is speeding up (three new motels last year and five new motels this year) or slowing down (five last year and three this year). For stocks of companies such as Sensormatic Electronics, whose sales are primarily \u201cone-shot\u201d deals\u2014as opposed to razor blades, which customers have to keep on buying\u2014a slowdown in growth can be devastating.\n\n**\n**\n**TURNAROUNDS**\n\n\u2022 Most important, can the company survive a raid by its creditors? How much cash does the company have? How much debt? (Apple Computer had $200 million in cash and no debt at the time of its crisis, so once again you knew it wasn\u2019t going out of business.) What is the debt structure, and how long can it operate in the red while working out its problems without going bankrupt? (International Harvester\u2014 now Navistar\u2014was a potential turnaround that has disappointed investors, because the company printed and sold millions of new shares to raise capital. This dilution resulted in the company\u2019s having turned around, but not the stock.)\n\n\u2022 If it\u2019s bankrupt already, then what\u2019s left for the shareholders?\n\n\u2022 How is the company supposed to be turning around? Has it rid itself of unprofitable divisions?\n\n\u2022 Is business coming back?\n\u2022 Are costs being cut? If so, what will the effect be?\n\n**ASSET PLAYS**\n\u2022 What\u2019s the value of the assets? Are there any hidden assets?\n\n\u2022 How much debt is there to detract from these assets? (Creditors are first in line.)\n\n\u2022 Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?\n\n\u2022 Is there a raider in the wings to help shareholders reap the benefits of the assets?",

However, people in the paper industry normally give out tips on drug stocks, and people in the health care field never run out of tips on the coming takeovers in the paper industry.\n\n\u2022 Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favor, and haven\u2019t caught the fancy of Wall Street.\n\n\u2022 Moderately fast growers (20 to 25 percent) in nongrowth industries are ideal investments.\n\n\u2022 Look for companies with niches.\n\n\u2022 When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with the superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.\n\n\u00a0\u2022 Companies that have no debt can\u2019t go bankrupt.\n\n\u2022 Managerial ability may be important, but it\u2019s quite difficult to assess.

        "\"25 GOLDEN RULES\nThe most important lessons learnt from two decades of investing\n\u2022 Investing is fun, exciting, and dangerous if you don\u2019t do any work.\n\n\u2022 Your investor\u2019s edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It\u2019s something you already have. You can outperform the experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand.\n\n\u2022 Over the past three decades, the stock market has come to be dominated by a herd of professional investors. Contrary to popular belief, this makes it easier for the amateur investor. You can beat the market by ignoring the herd.\n\n\u2022 Behind every stock is a company. Find out what it\u2019s doing.\n\n\u2022 Often, there is no correlation between the success of a company\u2019s operations and the success of its stock over a few months or even a few years. In the long term, there is a 100 percent correlation between the success of the company and the success of its stock. This disparity is the key to making money; it pays to be patient, and to own successful companies.\n\n\u2022 You have to know what you own, and why you own it. \u201cThis baby is a cinch to go up!\u201d doesn\u2019t count.\n\n\u2022 Long shots almost always miss the mark.\n\n\u2022 Owning stocks is like having children\u2014don\u2019t get involved with more than you can handle. The part-time stockpicker probably has time to follow 8\u201312 companies, and to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant. There don\u2019t have to be more than 5 companies in the portfolio at any one time.\n\n\u2022 If you can\u2019t find any companies that you think are attractive, put your money in the bank until you discover some.\n\n\u2022 Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets. Always look at the balance sheet to see if a company is solvent before you risk your money on it.\n\n\u2022 Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. Great companies in cold, nongrowth industries are consistent big winners.\n\n\u2022 With small companies, you\u2019re better off to wait until they turn a profit before you invest.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re thinking about investing in a troubled industry, buy the companies with staying power. Also, wait for the industry to show signs of revival. Buggy whips and radio tubes were troubled industries that never came back.\n\n\u2022 If you invest $1,000 in a stock, all you can lose is $1,000, but you stand to gain $10,000 or even $50,000 over time if you\u2019re patient. The average person can concentrate on a few good companies, while the fund manager is forced to diversify. By owning too many stocks, you lose this advantage of concentration. It only takes a handful of big winners to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile.\n\n\u2022 In every industry and every region of the country, the observant amateur can find great growth companies long before the professionals have discovered them.\n\n\u2022 A stock-market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If you\u2019re prepared, it can\u2019t hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic.\n\n\u2022 Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and stock mutual funds altogether.\n\n\u2022 There is always something to worry about. Avoid weekend thinking and ignore the latest dire predictions of the newscasters. Sell a stock because the company\u2019s fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.\n\n\u2022 Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy, or the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what\u2019s actually happening to the companies in which you\u2019ve invested.\n\n\u2022 If you study 10 companies, you\u2019ll find 1 for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you\u2019ll find 5. There are always pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market\u2014companies whose achievements are being overlooked on Wall Street.\n\n\u2022 If you don\u2019t study any companies, you have the same success buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards.\n\n\u2022 Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. You can afford to be patient\u2014even if you missed Wal-Mart in the first five years, it was a great stock to own in the next five years. Time is against you when you own options.\n\n\u2022 If you have the stomach for stocks, but neither the time nor the inclination to do the homework, invest in equity mutual funds. Here, it\u2019s a good idea to diversify. You should own a few different kinds of funds, with managers who pursue different styles of investing: growth, value, small companies, large companies, etc. Investing in six of the same kind of fund is not diversification. The capital-gains tax penalizes investors who do too much switching from one mutual fund to another. If you\u2019ve invested in one fund or several funds that have done well, don\u2019t abandon them capriciously. Stick with them.\n\n\u2022 Among the major stock markets of the world, the U.S. market ranks eighth in total return over the past decade. You can take advantage of the faster-growing economies by investing some portion of your assets in an overseas fund with a good record.\n\n\u2022 In the long run, a portfolio of well-chosen stocks and/or equity mutual funds will always outperform a portfolio of bonds or a money-market account. In the long run, a portfolio of poorly chosen stocks won\u2019t outperform the money left under the mattress.\"",

A young physician consulted me because of his\u00a0fear of perspiring. Whenever he expected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive sweating. In order to cut this circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should recur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat.

By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety. Such a procedure, however, must make use of the specifically human\u00a0capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor. This basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever the logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied.At the same time, the patient is enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis.",

Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'If you're so smart, why ain't You rich? ' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child's hand-glued to a lollipop stick and, flying from the cash register.\n\nAmericans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue, the monograph went on. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves. Once this is understood the disagreeable behavior of American enlisted men in German prisons ceases to be a mystery.\n\nEvery other army in history, prosperous or not, has attempted to clothe even its lowliest soldiers so as to make them impressive to themselves and others as stylish experts in drinking and copulation and looting and sudden death. The American Army, however, sends its enlisted men out to fight and die in a modified business suit quite evidently made for another man, a sterilized but unpressed gift from a noseholding charity which passes out clothing to drunks in the slums. When a dashingly-clad officer addresses such a frumpishly dressed bum, he scolds him, as an officer in an army must. But the officer's contempt is not, as in 'other armies, avuncular theatricality. It is a genuine expression of hatred for the poor, who have no one to blame for their misery but themselves. A prison administrator dealing with captured American enlisted men for the first time should be warned: Expect no brotherly love, even between brothers. There will be no cohesion between the individuals. Each will be a sulky child who often wishes he were dead.\"",

        "\"The ten rules of ikigai\n1. Stay active; don\u2019t retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your \u201cofficial\u201d professional activity has ended.\n\n2. Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, \u201cWalk slowly and you\u2019ll go far.\u201d When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.\n\n3. Don\u2019t fill your stomach. Less is more when it comes to eating for long life, too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.\n\n4. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.\n\n5. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn\u2019t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy.\n\n6. Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing\u2014it also helps make friends. It\u2019s good to recognize the things that aren\u2019t so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.\n\n7. Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often to recharge our batteries.\n\n8. Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every day giving thanks, and you\u2019ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.\n\n9. Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.\n\n10. Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you don\u2019t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to discover it.\"",
