Centuries ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a leisurely pace too.

Our new-found knowledge leads to faster economic, social and political changes; in an attempt to understand what is happening, we accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, which leads only to faster and greater upheavals. Consequently we are less and less able to make sense of the present or forecast the future. In 1016 it was relatively easy to predict how Europe would look in 1050. Sure, dynasties might fall, unknown raiders might invade, and natural disasters might strike; yet it was clear that in 1050 Europe would still be ruled by kings and priests, that it would be an agricultural society, that most of its inhabitants would be peasants, and that it would continue to suffer greatly from famines, plagues and wars. In contrast, in 2016 we have no idea how Europe will look in 2050. We cannot say what kind of political system it will have, how its job market will be structured, or even what kind of bodies its inhabitants will possess.\"",

        "title": "\"Some 2,300 years ago Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy.",
        "body": "A couple of centuries earlier Buddha had made an even more radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering. Such sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them, we don’t react to them with contentment; rather, we just crave for more. Hence no matter how many blissful or exciting sensations I may experience, they will never satisfy me.\n\nThis Buddhist view of happiness has a lot in common with the biochemical view. Both agree that pleasant sensations disappear as fast as they arise, and that as long as people crave pleasant sensations without actually experiencing them, they remain dissatisfied. However, this problem has two very different solutions. The biochemical solution is to develop products and treatments that will provide humans with an unending stream of pleasant sensations, so we will never be without them. The Buddha’s suggestion was to reduce our craving for pleasant sensations, and not allow them to control our lives. According to Buddha, we can train our minds to observe carefully how all sensations constantly arise and pass. When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are – ephemeral and meaningless vibrations – we lose interest in pursuing them. For what is the point of running after something that disappears as fast as it arises? At present, humankind has far greater interest in the biochemical solution. No matter what monks in their Himalayan caves or philosophers in their ivory towers say, for the capitalist juggernaut, happiness is pleasure. Period. With each passing year our tolerance for unpleasant sensations decreases, and our craving for pleasant sensations increases. Both scientific research and economic activity are geared to that end, each year producing better painkillers, new ice-cream flavours, more comfortable mattresses, and more addictive games for our smartphones, so that we will not suffer a single boring moment while waiting for the bus. All this is hardly enough, of course. Since Homo sapiens was not adapted by evolution to experience constant pleasure, if that is what humankind nevertheless wants, ice cream and smartphone games will not do. It will be necessary to change our biochemistry and re-engineer our bodies and minds. So we are working on that. You may debate whether it is good or bad, but it seems that the second great project of the twenty-first century – to ensure global happiness – will involve re-engineering Homo sapiens so that it can enjoy everlasting pleasure.\"",

What might have happened if a rare mutation had created a squirrel who, after eating a single nut, enjoys an everlasting sensation of bliss? Technically, this could actually be done by rewiring the squirrel’s brain. Who knows, perhaps it really happened to some lucky squirrel millions of years ago. But if so, that squirrel enjoyed an extremely happy and extremely short life, and that was the end of the rare mutation. For the blissful squirrel would not have bothered to look for more nuts, let alone mates. The rival squirrels, who felt hungry again five minutes after eating a nut, had much better chances of surviving and passing their genes to the next generation. For exactly the same reason, the nuts we humans seek to gather – lucrative jobs, big houses, good-looking partners – seldom satisfy us for long\"",

Achieving real happiness is not going to be much easier than overcoming old age and death. The glass ceiling of happiness is held in place by two stout pillars, one psychological, the other biological. On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. We don’t become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon. Dramatic improvements in conditions, as humankind has experienced in recent decades, translate into greater expectations rather than greater contentment. If we don’t do something about this, our future achievements too might leave us as dissatisfied as ever. On the biological level, both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our biochemistry, rather than by our economic, social or political situation. According to Epicurus, we are happy when we feel pleasant sensations and are free from unpleasant ones. Jeremy Bentham similarly maintained that nature gave dominion over man to two masters – pleasure and pain – and they alone determine everything we do, say and think. Bentham’s successor, John Stuart Mill, explained that happiness is nothing but pleasure and freedom from pain, and that beyond pleasure and pain there is no good and no evil. Anyone who tries to deduce good and evil from something else (such as the word of God, or the national interest) is fooling you, and perhaps fooling himself too.\"",

Epicurus outlined an entire ethic of dos and don’ts to guide people along the treacherous path to happiness. Epicurus was apparently on to something. Being happy doesn’t come easy. Despite our unprecedented achievements in the last few decades, it is far from obvious that contemporary people are significantly more satisfied than their ancestors in bygone years.

        "body": "These countries are small in size, but are inhabited by a brave, strong, and warlike people. During the present British rule of India, Britain often went to Nepal in search of soldiers in order to rule the Indians. A great deal of money by way of subsidies had to be spent before Britain was allowed to dispatch a political observer to Nepal. Even a great Power such as Great Britain had to respect her; Nepal was, in fact, a great Power in Asia. But what is the attitude of Nepal toward Great Britain during the past hundred years? Over hundred years ago India was conquered by Great Britain, and during this period Nepal was able to live peacefully on the border of the British colony. Although hundred years have passed, Nepal has never sent tribute to Great Britain. Great Britain, on the other hand, has to spend a large 'sum by way of subsidies to Nepal. But what is the attitude of Nepal toward China? The status of China has deteriorated to such an extent that it is now inferior even to that of a British colony. Though far away from China Proper and separated from her by Tibet. Nepal considered China as her suzerain State and up to 1911 Nepal sent annual tribute to China via Tibet. In that year, however, when the Nepal commissioners reached Szechuan and found communications interrupted, they returned to their country. The differential attitude of Nepal toward Great Britain and toward China is due to the difference between the Oriental and Occidental civilization. China has degenerated during the last several hundred years, yet Nepal still respects her as a superior State. Great Britain, on the other hand, is a powerful country, but Nepal has been influenced by Chinese civilization, which, in her eyes, is the true civilization, while that of Britain is nothing but the rule of Might.\n\nNow, what is the problem that underlies Pan-Asianism, the Principle of Greater Asia, which we are discussing here to-day?\n\nBriefly, it is a cultural problem, a problem of comparison and conflict between the Oriental and Occidental culture and civilization. Oriental civilization is the rule of Right; Occidental civilization is the rule of Might. The rule of Right respects benevolence and virtue, while the rule of Might only respects force and utilitarianism. The rule of Right always influences people with justice and reason, while the rule of Might always oppresses people with brute force and military measures. People who are influenced by justice and virtue will never forget their superior State, even if that country has become weak. So Nepal even now willingly respects China as a superior State. People who are oppressed by force never submit entirely to the oppressor State. The relations of Great Britain with Egypt and India form a typical example. Although under British rule, Egypt and India have always entertained the thought of independence and separation from Great Britain. If, Great Britain becomes weaker some day, Egypt and India will overthrow British rule and regain their independence within five years. You should now realize which is the superior civilization, the Oriental or the Occidental?\n\nIf we want to realize Pan-Asianism in this new world, what should be its foundation if not our ancient civilization and culture? Benevolence and virtue must be the foundations of Pan-Asianism. With this as a sound foundation we must then learn science from Europe for our industrial development and the improvement of our armaments, not, however, with a view to oppressing or destroying other countries and peoples as the Europeans have done, but purely for our self-defense.\"",

We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.\n\nGreed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…\n\nThe aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.\n\nTo those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…\n\nSoldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!\n\nIn the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.\n\nThen - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!\n\nDictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!\"",

(“It is really going up!” doesn’t count.)\n\n• By putting your stocks into categories you’ll have a better idea of what to expect from them.\n\n• Big companies have small moves, small companies have big moves.\n\n• Consider the size of a company if you expect it to profit from a specific product.\n\n• Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept can be replicated.\n\n• Be suspicious of companies with growth rates of 50 to 100 percent a year.\n• Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.\n• Distrust diversifications, which usually turn out to be diworseifications.\n• Long shots almost never pay off.\n\n• It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a company’s plans are working out.\n\n• People get incredibly valuable fundamental information from their jobs that may not reach the professionals for months or even years.\n\n• Separate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very smart, very rich, and his onr her last tip went up.\n\n• Some stock tips, especially from an expert in the field, may turn out to be quite valuable. However, people in the paper industry normally give out tips on drug stocks, and people in the health care field never run out of tips on the coming takeovers in the paper industry.\n\n• Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favor, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street.\n\n• Moderately fast growers (20 to 25 percent) in nongrowth industries are ideal investments.\n\n• Look for companies with niches.\n\n• When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with the superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.\n\n • Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.\n\n• Managerial ability may be important, but it’s quite difficult to assess. Base your purchases on the company’s prospects, not on the president’s resume or speaking ability.\n\n• A lot of money can be made when a troubled company turns around.\n\n• Carefully consider the price-earnings ratio. If the stock is grossly overpriced, even if everything else goes right, you won’t make any money.\n\n• Find a story line to follow as a way of monitoring a company’s progress.\n• Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares.\n\n• Study the dividend record of a company over the years and also how its earnings have fared in past recessions.\n\n• Look for companies with little or no institutional ownership.\n\n• All else being equal, favor companies in which management has a significant personal investment over companies run by people that benefit only from their salaries.\n\n• Insider buying is a positive sign, especially when several individuals are buying at once.\n\n• Devote at least an hour a week to investment research. Adding up your dividends and figuring out your gains and losses doesn’t count.\n\n• Be patient. Watched stock never boils.\n\n• Buying stocks based on stated book value alone is dangerous and illusory. It’s real value that counts.\n\n• When in doubt, tune in later.\n\n• Invest at least as much time and effort in choosing a new stock as you would in choosing a new refrigerator.\"",

It takes years, not months, to produce big results.\n\n• Different categories of stocks have different risks and rewards.\n\n• You can make serious money by compounding a series of 20–30 percent gains in stalwarts.\n\n• Stock prices often move in opposite directions from the fundamentals but long term, the direction and sustainability of profits will prevail.\n\n• Just because a company is doing poorly doesn’t mean it can’t do worse.\n• Just because the price goes up doesn’t mean you’re right.\n• Just because the price goes down doesn’t mean you’re wrong.\n\n• Stalwarts with heavy institutional ownership and lots of Wall Street coverage that have outperformed the market and are overpriced are due for a rest or a decline.\n\n• Buying a company with mediocre prospects just because the stock is cheap is a losing technique.\n\n• Selling an outstanding fast grower because its stock seems slightly overpriced is a losing technique.\n\n• Companies don’t grow for no reason, nor do fast growers stay that way forever.\n\n• You don’t lose anything by not owning a successful stock, even if its a tenbagger.\n\n• A stock does not know that you own it.\n\n• Don’t become so attached to a winner that complacency sets in and you stop monitoring the story.\n\n• If a stock goes to zero, you lose just as much money whether you bought it at $50, $25, $5, or $2—everything you invested.\n\n• By careful pruning and rotation based on fundamentals, you can improve your results. When stocks are out of line with reality and better alternatives exist, sell them and switch into something else.\n\n• When favorable cards turn up, add to your bet, and vice versa.\n• You won’t improve results by pulling out the flowers and watering the weeds.\n\n• If you don’t think you can beat the market, then buy a mutual fund and save yourself a lot of extra work and money.\n\n• There is always something to worry about.\n• Keep an open mind to new ideas.\n\n• You don’t have to “kiss all the girls.” I’ve missed my share of tenbaggers and it hasn’t kept me from beating the market.\"",

The professor found that the average price of a Melbourne property from 1901 to 2015 increased by an average 2.1 per cent per year, after factoring in inflation. But wait, there’s more: that 2.1 per cent doesn’t include the money spent on paying interest to the bank, or maintenance spent on the home.\n\nProfessor Robert Shiller, of Yale University, looked at long-term US property prices from 1890 to 2004 and found that inflation-adjusted house prices increased by a miniscule 0.4 per cent annually.\n\nAnd just to round out the Western world, Professor Piet Eichholtz of Maastricht University looked at property prices in Europe, specifically on one of Amsterdam’s most significant canals, Herengracht. He was able to track the buys and sells of a single property for a full 345 years. The result? A return of 0.2 per cent per annum after inflation. Real home prices did roughly double, but they took nearly 350 years to do so, says Shiller.\n\nNow it’s true that, in some areas in Australia, property has doubled every seven to 10 years over the past 24 years — but not when you factor in inflation, interest costs, upkeep and maintenance. What’s more, these figures only show the sale price, not the money spent building or renovating. Say I buy a house for $500 000, demolish it and spend $1 million building a new home. I later sell it for $1.5 million. How much have I made? Zero. Yet the house price data reports that the price has gone up 200 per cent.\n\nWhen you look at the past 24 years from a historical view, this period has been an outlier — a once-in-a-lifetime boom — brought on by some unique factors: mortgage interest rates falling from a peak of 18 per cent in the late 80s to around 4 per cent today household debt ballooning to 175 per cent of household income, the highest in the world tax breaks for negatively geared properties, which have encouraged Baby Boomers to borrow on the equity in their homes to buy loss-making investments.

Here’s another way to explain it:\n\nLet’s say you invested $100 000 in a no-brainer index fund (that automatically buys all the companies that make up a sharemarket index, and tracks the market), and then headed off to the Thai island of Ko Pha Ngan and did nothing but drink buckets of whisky on the beach for the next 30 years. When you return, your $100 000 investment would be worth $2 351 916.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’d diligently read the Wall Street Journal each morning — hired a financial advisor to pick the latest hot share funds; spent your nights stressing about the 1987 crash, the Asian Financial Crisis and the Global Financial Crisis; and basically behaved like everyone else — 30 years later you’d have … $297 415.

For her, a man who wants to stop and navel-gaze is not as good a model as the one who commits himself to keep going. Why do we imagine that wisdom lies in inactivity and detachment, she asks? If a child says, ‘I don’t care about anything,’ that is not a sign of a wise child but of a troubled and depressed one. Similarly, adults who withdraw from the world soon get bored. Even lovers, if they retreat to their private love nest for too long, lose interest in each other. We do not thrive in satiety and rest. Human existence means ‘transcendence’, or going beyond, not ‘immanence’, or reposing passively inside oneself. It means constant action until the day one runs out of things to do — a day that is unlikely to come as long as you have breath.

        "body": "Now, some people will compound their career by either climbing the ladder or ‘bringing home the bacon’. Others are happy to get a bit on the side and earn some extra coin. If you start your business off part time, you may work out that what you’ve really got is a great part-time gig that can domino your debts or build a huge investment portfolio. What’s so bad about that? Then there’s people like me, who enjoy their side business so much that they make it their life’s work. If this is you, awesome. But I advise you follow a strategy I call ‘swinging on the trapeze’. And it’s this: don’t let go of the swinging bar (your secure pay cheque) until you’re safely holding the next pay cheque (from your successful business). Let me show you how not to swing from the trapeze. Colin works in Accounts at his local shire office. He wants something more in life, so he abruptly quits his job to start his own event planning business. Here’s what that looks like: With a copy of How to Start a Lifestyle Business in 4 Steps, Colin jumps off the ledge without a safety net. ‘I can’t even see the trapeze bar, but I’m jumping anyway: I’ve never felt more alive!’ The crowd hold their breath. Guess what happens next? Splat! When I started the Barefoot Investor I made sure I didn’t jump till I was ready. For years I worked 80-hour weeks, combining full-time, freelance and unpaid work. If you’re not willing to do that for at least the first 12 months, there’s a good chance that — like Colin — what you’re really doing is running away from a job you don’t like. If you can’t handle very, very hard work, you’re probably not cut out for running your own business.\"",

This can be effective if you want to give the other person control or allow him to feel that he is in charge of the situation if for example, you were making an apology. While the palm-up handshake can communicate a submissive attitude, there are sometimes other circumstances to consider. As we have seen, a person with arthritis in their hands will be forced to give you a limp handshake because of their condition and this makes it easy to turn their palm into the submissive position. People who use their hands in their profession, such as surgeons, artists and musicians, may also give a limp handshake, purely to protect their hands.\n\n![screenshot_2020-11-30-06-56-16-25_58f827c9f8cd1dffd850cad9571f3f22.jpg](:/0cf37d61340603851560fa6ada551359)\n\nWhen two dominant people shake hands, a symbolic power struggle takes place as each person attempts to turn the other's palm into the submissive position.

        "body": "Most job interviews are non-productive because studies show a strong correlation between how much the interviewer likes the interviewee and whether or not they get the job. In the end, most of the factual information that comes from the curriculum vitae — the real stuff about the candidate that is a good indicator of performance - is forgotten. What is remembered is the impression the candidate made on the interview. Let's assume you're going to an interview and you want to make the best first impression. Keep in mind that others form up to 90% of their opinion about you in the first four minutes and that 60 to 80% of the impact you will make is non-verbal. Here are nine Golden Keys to getting it right first time in an interview:\n\n1.  In the Reception Area\n\nRemove your outerwear and give it to the receptionist if possible. Avoid entering an office with your arms full of clutter that can make you fumble and look inept. Always stand in a reception area — never sit. Receptionists will insist you 'take a seat' because when you do, you're out of sight and they no longer have to deal with you. Stand with Hand-in-Hand behind your back (confidence) and slowly rock back and forth on your feet (confident, controlled) or use the Steeple gesture. This body language is a constant reminder that you are still there and waiting. But never do this at the Tax Office.\n\n2.The Entry\n\nYour entry tells others how you expect to be treated. When the receptionist has given you the green light to enter, walk in without hesitation. Do not stand in the doorway like a naughty schoolchild waiting to see the headmaster. When you walk through the door of the person's office, maintain the same speed. People who lack confidence change gears and perform a small shuffle as they enter.\n\n3.The Approach\n\nEven if the person is on the phone, rummaging through a drawer or tying his shoelaces, walk in directly and confidently with a smooth motion. Put down your briefcase, folder or what- ever is in your hands, shake the person's hand and immediately take a seat. Let the other person see that you are accustomed to walking confidently into offices and that you don't expect to be kept waiting. People who walk slowly or take long strides convey that they have plenty of time on their hands, are not interested in what they are doing or have nothing else to do. This is fine for retired millionaires and those who live in Florida and Queensland, but not for anyone who wants to convey power, authority or capability or that they are a healthy, potential mate. Influential people and those who command attention walk briskly at a medium pace with medium length strides.\n\n4.The Handshake\n\nKeep your palm straight and return the pressure you receive. Let the other person decide when to end the handshake. Step to the left of a rectangular desk as you approach to avoid being given a Palm-Down handshake. Never shake directly across a desk. Use a person's name twice in the first 15 seconds and never talk for more than 30 seconds at a time.\n\n5.  When You Sit\n\nIf you are compelled to sit in a low chair directly facing the other person, turn it away 45 degrees from the person to avoid being stuck in the 'reprimand' position. If you can't angle the chair, angle your body instead.\n\n6.  Seating Areas\n\nIf you're invited to sit in an informal area of the person's office, such as at an informal coffee table, this is a positive sign because 95% of business rejections are delivered from behind a desk. Never sit on a low sofa that sinks so low it makes you look like a giant pair of legs topped by a small head - if nec- essary, sit upright on the edge so you can control your body language and gestures, and angle your body to 45 degrees away from the person.\n\n7.Your Gestures\n\nPeople who are cool, calm, collected and in control of their emotions use clear, uncomplicated, deliberate movements. High-status individuals use fewer gestures than low-status individuals. This is an ancient negotiating ploy — people with power don't have to move much. Keep in mind that Eastern Europeans gesture more from the elbow down than Westerners, and Southern Europeans gesture more with their entire arms and shoulders. Mirror the other person's gestures and expressions when appropriate.\n\n8.  Distance\n\nRespect the other person's Personal Space, which will be largest in the opening minutes of the meeting. If you move too close, the person will respond by sitting back, leaning away or using repetitive gestures such as drumming the fingers. As a rule, you can move closer to familiar people but further back from new ones. Men generally move closer to women they work with while women generally move further back when they work with men. Work closer to those of similar age and further back from significantly older or younger ones.\n\n9.Your Exit\n\nPack your things calmly and deliberately - not in a frenzy - shake hands if possible, turn and walk out. If the door was closed when you entered, close it behind you as you leave. People always watch you from behind as you leave so, if you're a man, make sure you have shined the back of your shoes. This is an area many men neglect and women are critical of this.\"",

Of what can we be absolutely certain? Very few scientists would claim such certitude about even their most rigorously tested findings. As Descartes and many other philosophers in the East and West have noted, the very existence of an independent, objective, physical world may be called into question. Perhaps it, too, is an illusion. This is the basic premise of philosophical idealism. On the other hand, many materialists claim that all our subjective mental experiences are illusory, and most cognitive scientists have concluded that our normal sense of an autonomous self is an illusion. But in the midst of all these uncertainties, I propose there is one kind of knowledge of which we can be absolutely certain: our knowledge of the presence of consciousness. Even if we are not sure there is a distinct observer—the self—it is unreasonable to doubt that conscious experience takes place. Without it, it would be impossible to doubt its existence.\"",

        "body": "After settling your body in its ground state and attending to your breath for a few moments, bring to mind a person you know well, whose background and living circumstances are familiar to you but who is neither a friend nor an enemy. Attend to this person. This person, like yourself, is striving for happiness and freedom from pain, fear, and insecurity. Focus on this person and shift your awareness to view the world from her eyes. From this point of view, look back on yourself. Regardless of the distinct defects or excellent qualities this person might have, her yearning for happiness and wish to be free from pain and grief are identical to your own. Even though she is not close to the center of your personal universe, her well-being is no less significant than that of a dear loved one whom you may regard as crucial to your happiness.\n\nNow bring to mind a person you feel is crucial to your well-being, a person for whom you have both affection and attachment. Attend closely to this loved one, and shift your awareness to the viewpoint of that person so that you perceive him as a human being like yourself, with both defects and excellent qualities. From this viewpoint, realize that although you are loved by some people, a great number of people feel indifferently toward you, and there also may be some people who don’t like you. This person for whom you feel affection and attachment feels his own desires, hopes, and fears. Now step back and attend to this person from outside. This person is not a true source of your happiness, security, or joy, which can only arise from your own heart and mind.\n\nNext bring to mind a person who may be intent on bringing you harm or depriving you of happiness, a person with whom you feel conflict. As before, imagine stepping into this person’s perspective, being this person from the inside, and experiencing her hopes and fears. Fundamentally, this person, like yourself, wishes to find happiness and freedom from suffering. Now, step back and attend to her from outside with the realization that she is not the source of your distress or anxiety. If you feel uneasy or angry in relationship to this person, the source is in your own heart, not in the other person.\n\nRealize that there is nothing inherent in the stranger, in the loved one, nor in the foe that makes the other person fall into one category or another. Circumstances change, relationships change, and it is the flux of circumstances that gives rise to the thoughts “this is my enemy” or “this is my loved one.” Expand the field of awareness to embrace everyone in your immediate environment, their hopes, fears, aspirations, and yearnings. Each person is as important as all others. Shifting circumstances bring us together and also cause us to part. Expand your field of awareness out over the whole community, reaching out in all directions, including everyone. Recognize that each person is fundamentally like yourself, and virtually everyone feels himself to be the center of his world. Imagine the pure depths of your own awareness, unsullied by the obscurations of self-centered attachment and aversion, as an orb of radiant white light at your heart. With each exhalation, let this light spread out evenly in all directions to all persons with the yearning, “May each one, including myself, find happiness. May everyone, including myself, be free of suffering and the causes of suffering.” Imagine a flood of light going out in all directions, soothing those who are distressed and bringing healing, happiness, and a sense of well-being to everyone. With each in-breath, draw in the distress and causes of unhappiness and pain of each sentient being. Imagine this as a dark cloud that dissolves into the light at your heart, and imagine all beings free of suffering and its causes. Before you bring this session to a close, rest for a moment without bringing anything to mind. Settle your awareness in its own nature, with no object and with no subject. This is the even-mindedness that is a fertile foundation for all spiritual practices.\"",

We suffer because our minds are afflicted by various kinds of imbalances, which lead us to seek happiness in all the wrong places. But we can emerge from this hedonic treadmill by identifying what truly ails us and what truly brings us satisfaction. Buddhists refer to this shift in priorities as the arousal of a spirit of emergence, with which we move away from the sources of discontent and set out on the path to genuine happiness. This is the most compassionate thing we can do for ourselves.\n\nNone of us lives in isolation, no matter how lonely or alienated we may feel at times. Our welfare is intimately linked to everyone around us, especially those with whom we are in frequent contact. As we learn to be compassionate and nonjudgmental toward ourselves, it is only natural to extend this gentle heart to others.

It’s as if you repeatedly lose your mind, then regain it for brief periods, only to lose it again and again. We all seem to be suffering from frequent bouts of amnesia!\"",

        "title": "\"Meditation on Loving -Kindness",
        "body": "Begin by resting your body in a comfortable position, sitting either cross-legged or on a chair. Bring your awareness to the physical sensations throughout your body, breathing into any areas that feel tense or constricted. Be still, and adopt a posture of vigilance. Then take three slow, deep breaths, breathing through your nostrils, down into your belly, expanding the diaphragm and finally the chest. Exhale effortlessly, settling your body in its resting state. Attend to the rhythm of your breath for a few moments, letting it flow unconstrained by restless thoughts and emotions. Settle your awareness in a space of relaxation, stillness, and clarity.\n\nNow, from within this serenity, arouse your imagination with three questions. The first one is, What would I love to receive from the world in order to have a happy, meaningful, and fulfilling life? Some of these things may be tangible goods, such as food, lodging, clothing, and medical care. But other requisites for your well-being may be intangible, such as harmony in your environment, the warm companionship of others, and wise counsel to guide you on your spiritual journey. Bring clearly to mind the things you desire to meet your basic needs. Then allow the yearning to arise: may these authentic desires be fulfilled!\n\nNow pursue this vision for your own happiness more deeply. Clearly see your basic needs being fulfilled, and inquire further into what more you would love to receive from the people around you and from the environment at large. What could they provide you that would help you find the happiness you seek? You may bring to mind both tangible and intangible things, whatever you feel would assist you in fulfilling your heart’s desire. Imagine that the world rises up to meet you, here and now, and provides you with all the external support that is needed to fulfill your aspirations.\n\nEach of us is constantly changing from moment to moment, day to day, as our bodies and minds are continually in a state of flux. The next question is, What kind of a person do I want to become? What personal qualities do I want to possess? You are changing all the time whether you choose to or not, so envision the changes you would love to experience in your evolution as a human being. Imagine both short-term and long-term changes. And as you envision the person you would love to evolve into, imagine that this transformation is actually taking place, here and now.\n\nNone of us lives in absolute isolation from others, no matter where or how we live. We can’t help but influence those around us through both our action and our inaction. We are making an impact on the world, whether we want to or not. The last question you may ask yourself is, What would I love to offer to the world, to those around me and to the environment at large? What kind of a mark would I love to make on the world? Invite this vision into your field of consciousness, embellishing it with as many details as you can think of, and then imagine that this dream is being realized here and now.\n\nJust as you seek happiness for yourself, so do all the people in your neighborhood yearn for their own fulfillment. Expand the field of your loving awareness to embrace each sentient being, human and nonhuman, in your neighborhood, wishing, “May each of you, like myself, find the happiness you seek, and may you cultivate its true causes!” Continue to extend your loving-kindness to everyone around you, gradually expanding your circle until it includes all beings throughout the world, each one seeking happiness just like you.\"",

        "body": "The term conation refers to our faculty of desire and volition. Conative balance, a crucial element of mental health, is expressed when our desires are conducive to our own and others’ genuine happiness. Conative imbalances, on the other hand, are ways that our desires lead us away from mental health and into psychological distress. Such imbalances are threefold: conative deficit, conative hyperactivity, and conative dysfunction.\n\nA conative deficit occurs when we experience apathy toward greater happiness and its causes. This apathy is normally accompanied by a lack of imagination and a kind of stagnation: we can’t imagine feeling better than we do now, so we don’t try to do anything about it. This robs us of the incentive to achieve greater mental well-being. Conative hyperactivity occurs when obsessive desires obscure the reality of the present. Fantasies about the future—unfulfilled desires—blind us to what is happening here and now. Finally, conative dysfunction is when we do desire things that are destructive to our own or others’ well-being, and don’t desire the things that lead to genuine happiness for both ourselves and others. I include “others” here because we cannot cultivate optimal mental balance in isolation from others. We do not exist independently from others, so our well-being cannot arise independently of others either. To flourish individually, we must consider the well-being of those around us.

When reality breaks through our fantasies, disillusionment sets in. That in turn may lead to hostility and aversion, causing us to now project negative qualities upon the object we once craved.\"",

Such disturbances are symptoms of an unbalanced mind.\n\nThese two dysfunctional tendencies seem to be intrinsic to the mind. Hyperactivity is characterized by excitation, agitation, and distraction, while an attention deficit is characterized by laxity, dullness, and lethargy. When our minds are subject to these two imbalances, we have little control over what happens in our minds. We may believe in free will, but we can hardly be called “free” if we can’t direct our own attention.

        "body": "Throughout this book we have discussed your body as if you are trying to extract maximum performance from a demanding machine. Now it's time for a body-related rule that won't make you cringe: Relax for at least half an hour before you go to sleep. When you schedule each day you should always indicate a cutoff point when you will stop all work. On a light day, early in a semester or right after exams, this cutoff may be relatively early in the evening. Which is great, go out and enjoy! But during the inevitable busy stretches, you will always have more work than you can accomplish on any given day, so for your own well-being you have to impose a deadline on your daily chaos. For me, during finals and midterms, this cutoff was usually around eleven P.M., but the specific time really depends on the urgency of your workload and when you typically go to bed. Here is what's important: after you pass your daily work cutoff point, never move right into sleep. If you go to bed with the stresses of the day fresh on your mind, you will have a harder time falling asleep, and psychologically you deny your mind the chance to recover from the pressures of the day. Instead, you should always relax for at least half an hour before going to sleep. Watch a TV show, read, play your guitar, talk to a friend. It doesn't matter what you do, as long as it doesn't involve any schoolwork and it makes you happy. Furthermore, really make an effort during this time to completely block out thoughts about upcoming obligations or work deadlines. Some of the happiest and most successful students I have ever met possess an almost superhuman ability to shut off stressful thoughts once they decide they are done for the day. This is a practiced skill, one you should work on. When you consistently fall asleep relaxed, you sleep better, you are happier, and you have more energy the next day. The work lost to your nighttime relaxation will be more than compensated for by your refreshed spirit the next morning.\"",

        "title": "\"You need look no further than the quiz-and-recall method. The details of this approach are simple.",
        "body": "For any material you have to learn, be it complicated social science theories, foreign language verb conjugations, or physics equations, your basic study method should always involve quizzing and recalling. I don't mean this lightly. Asking yourself a handful of review questions doesn't count. You should build your entire approach to studying around the concept that making yourself recall specific information is the absolute best way to learn.\n\nThis approach turns studying into a two-step process. The first step is the long and silent review of all the material that is going to be on the test. While you do this review, jot down your recall questions. If you ask about a topic from a specific book, jot down the page number where the answer can be found. If you ask about something from your notes, jot down the date of the relevant lecture. This will save a lot of time when you forget an answer later on.\n\nThe next step of the process is the quizzing. This is where the real learning actually happens. When quizzing yourself, you don't necessarily have to write down your answers. This might be necessary for solving math problems, but for discussion-style questions, feel free to formulate your response out loud. You can cover topics much quicker when you just have to talk as opposed to write. However, if speaking out loud, it's important that you still use complete sentences. The more clearly you articulate your thoughts, the more clearly you remember the information.\n\nThis technique is remarkably effective because it forces you to recall the information from scratch. The act of pulling the information from your memory and articulating the main points cements knowledge much stronger than just reading it over a couple of times. Reviewing notes on a topic can only take you so far. Your mind is perfectly willing to read the same words hundreds of times without making any real effort to remember them. But if you actually make yourself stare at a blank sheet of paper and recall answers from no other source than your brain, you will remember that material. This is guaranteed. Another trick is to involve emotion. Don't just sit at a desk and talk quietly. Stand up, pace your room, yell out answers, cover material as if lecturing to a fascinated class, and play inspiring music in the background. The more stimuli you provide your brain, the more connections to the material you will develop, and the better you will remember and understand it.\n\nIn fact, this technique saves you time and provides peace of mind. Your goal for studying is no longer an amorphous promise to “review all the relevant material”; instead, it's the much more specific “review all the relevant material until I can ace all my quizzes.” If you can pass your quizzes in two hours, then you are done studying in two hours. If it takes you three days, then you are done studying in three days—but at least at the end you will know you are ready. The quiz-and-recall method is near miraculous in its ability to consistently provide you with top results. And if you are innovative in your attempts to keep your energy level high while recalling the information, it can even be, dare we say it, fun. Whatever else you do to study, never approach an exam without first having made yourself recall all the relevant information from scratch.\"",

Imagine the mental difference between having a paper due in three weeks, and having three days to solidify a thesis statement.

The former is daunting and invites procrastination, the latter is approachable and motivating. This is not about tricking yourself into thinking you have something due when no actual deadline exists. It's about breaking large projects into smaller, short-term goals you can easily accomplish. By setting arbitrary deadlines, you blur the distinction between small and large assignments, and turn your schedule into one manageable flow of many small tasks.

Or to fly through a big math problem with ease but use the wrong algorithm. Bad grades happen, and this shouldn't be a big deal. As long as you put in the effort, who cares about one bad day?\n\nI once met a particularly awe-inspiring Rhodes Scholar who delighted in telling the story of how she bombed her final exam in a calculus course. Did this disaster ruin her academic career? Not at all. She may have made some dumb mistakes on one test, but in the end, she made sure she eventually conquered those concepts. In fact, the first step she took after her ill-fated exam was to head straight to her professor's office hours. She went over the exam with him in detail, separating dumb mistakes from actual misunderstandings and discussing the right answers until she felt in control of the material. She demonstrated so much enthusiasm for the subject that the professor invited her back to be a teaching assistant the next semester, even though her grade in the class wasn't anywhere near the A- usually required for becoming a T.A.\n\nThe point is that she didn't care about getting a bad grade. Her concern was with understanding the material. This focus on learning for the sake of learning, not for the sake of grades, may not have made her Valedictorian, but it did propel her to a diverse and exciting collegiate career—not to mention quite a few national awards and honors. If you begin to obsess about your G.P.A., much of the excitement of college is lost. Every test stops being an opportunity to show off your ability to engage the material, and instead becomes a potential devastation to your overall academic standing. Every paper stops being an exercise in crafting words, and instead creates recurring fear that you might have come to the wrong conclusion. And at the end of every term you will exist in a state of nervous apprehension as you wait for your final grades to be released. In short, obsessing about your G.P.A. makes your life stressful and can derail you from your larger goals. If you want to be a successful student, forget about your G.P.A. Ignore it. Don't talk about it. Make no attempt to know the numbers. You should approach your collegiate career with confidence and energy.When you have the occasional academic misstep, never look back, just move on.

        "body": "People consequently ascribe immense importance to what they feel, craving to experience more and more pleasures, while avoiding pain. Whatever we do throughout our lives, whether scratching our leg, fidgeting slightly in the chair, or fighting world wars, we are just trying to get pleasant feelings. The problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more than fleeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If five minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles. What is so important about obtaining such ephemeral prizes? Why struggle so hard to achieve something that disappears almost as soon as it arises? According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisfied. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them.\n\nThis is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices. In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body, witness the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and realise how pointless it is to pursue them. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied. All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing – joy, anger, boredom, lust – but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can just accept them for what they are. You live in the present moment instead of fantasising about what might have been. The resulting serenity is so profound that those who spend their lives in the frenzied pursuit of pleasant feelings can hardly imagine it. It is like a man standing for decades on the seashore, embracing certain ‘good’ waves and trying to prevent them from disintegrating, while simultaneously pushing back ‘bad’ waves to prevent them from getting near him. Day in, day out, the man stands on the beach, driving himself crazy with this fruitless exercise. Eventually, he sits down on the sand and just allows the waves to come and go as they please. How peaceful!\n\nBuddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.\"",

Huxley’s vision of the future is far more troubling than George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Huxley’s world seems monstrous to most readers, but it is hard to explain why. Everybody is happy all the time – what could be wrong with that?\n\nHuxley’s disconcerting world is based on the biological assumption that happiness equals pleasure. To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant bodily sensations. Since our biochemistry limits the volume and duration of these sensations, the only way to make people experience a high level of happiness over an extended period of time is to manipulate their biochemical system. But that definition of happiness is contested by some scholars. In a famous study, Daniel Kahneman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, asked people to recount a typical work day, going through it episode by episode and evaluating how much they enjoyed or disliked each moment. He discovered what seems to be a paradox in most people’s view of their lives. Take the work involved in raising a child. Kahneman found that when counting moments of joy and moments of drudgery, bringing up a child turns out to be a rather unpleasant affair. It consists largely of changing nappies, washing dishes and dealing with temper tantrums, which nobody likes to do. Yet most parents declare that their children are their chief source of happiness. Does it mean that people don’t really know what’s good for them? That’s one option. Another is that the findings demonstrate that happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather, happiness consists in seeing one’s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. There is an important cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the difference to whether we see ourselves as ‘miserable slaves to a baby dictator’ or as ‘lovingly nurturing a new life’. As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.\"",

Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose.

As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion. The other-worldly meanings medieval people found in their lives were no more deluded than the modern humanist, nationalist and capitalist meanings modern people find. The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness in that conviction.

Unfortunately for all hopes of creating heaven on earth, our internal biochemical system seems to be programmed to keep happiness levels relatively constant. There’s no natural selection for happiness as such – a happy hermit’s genetic line will go extinct as the genes of a pair of anxious parents get carried on to the next generation. Happiness and misery play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction. Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that evolution has moulded us to be neither too miserable nor too happy. It enables us to enjoy a momentary rush of pleasant sensations, but these never last for ever. Sooner or later they subside and give place to unpleasant sensations.\n\nFor example, evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males who spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to look for additional fertile females. Some scholars compare human biochemistry to an air-conditioning system that keeps the temperature constant, come heatwave or snowstorm. Events might momentarily change the temperature, but the air-conditioning system always returns the temperature to the same set point.\n\nSome air-conditioning systems are set at twenty-five degrees Celsius. Others are set at twenty degrees. Human happiness conditioning systems also differ from person to person. On a scale from one to ten, some people are born with a cheerful biochemical system that allows their mood to swing between levels six and ten, stabilising with time at eight. Such a person is quite happy even if she lives in an alienating big city, loses all her money in a stock-exchange crash and is diagnosed with diabetes. Other people are cursed with a gloomy biochemistry that swings between three and seven and stabilises at five. Such an unhappy person remains depressed even if she enjoys the support of a tight-knit community, wins millions in the lottery and is as healthy as an Olympic athlete. Indeed, even if our gloomy friend wins $50,000,000 in the morning, discovers the cure for both AIDS and cancer by noon, makes peace between Israelis and Palestinians that afternoon, and then in the evening reunites with her long-lost child who disappeared years ago – she would still be incapable of experiencing anything beyond level seven happiness. Her brain is simply not built for exhilaration, come what may. Think for a moment of your family and friends. You know some people who remain relatively joyful, no matter what befalls them. And then there are those who are always disgruntled, no matter what gifts the world lays at their feet. We tend to believe that if we could just change our workplace, get married, finish writing that novel, buy a new car or repay the mortgage, we would be on top of the world. Yet when we get what we desire we don’t seem to be any happier. Buying cars and writing novels do not change our biochemistry.

If this chapter had been written in 1945 or 1962, it would probably have been much more glum. Since it was written in 2014, it takes a relatively buoyant approach to modern history. To satisfy both optimists and pessimists, we may conclude by saying that we are on the threshold of both heaven and hell, moving nervously between the gateway of the one and the anteroom of the other. History has still not decided where we will end up, and a string of coincidences might yet send us rolling in either direction.\"",

For most of history, polities could enrich themselves by looting or annexing enemy territories. Most wealth consisted of fields, cattle, slaves and gold, so it was easy to loot it or occupy it. Today, wealth consists mainly of human capital, technical know-how and complex socio-economic structures such as banks. Consequently it is difficult to carry it off or incorporate it into one’s territory. Consider California. Its wealth was initially built on gold mines. But today it is built on silicon and celluloid – Silicon Valley and the celluloid hills of Hollywood. What would happen if the Chinese were to mount an armed invasion of California, land a million soldiers on the beaches of San Francisco and storm inland? They would gain little. There are no silicon mines in Silicon Valley. The wealth resides in the minds of Google engineers and Hollywood script doctors, directors and specialeffects wizards, who would be on the first plane to Bangalore or Mumbai long before the Chinese tanks rolled into Sunset Boulevard. It is not coincidental that the few full-scale international wars that still take place in the world, such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, occur in places were wealth is old-fashioned material wealth.

Yet the Soviet elite, and the Communist regimes through most of eastern Europe (Romania and Serbia were the exceptions), chose not to use even a tiny fraction of this military power. When its members realised that Communism was bankrupt, they renounced force, admitted their failure, packed their suitcases and went home. Gorbachev and his colleagues gave up without a struggle not only the Soviet conquests of World War Two, but also the much older tsarist conquests in the Baltic, the Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia.

Much like the Agricultural Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.\n\nCapitalism has two answers to this criticism. First, capitalism has created a world that nobody but a capitalist is capable of running. The only serious attempt to manage the world differently – Communism – was so much worse in almost every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again. In 8500 BC one could cry bitter tears over the Agricultural Revolution, but it was too late to give up agriculture. Similarly, we may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without it. The second answer is that we just need more patience – paradise, the capitalists promise, is right around the corner. True, mistakes have been made, such as the Atlantic slave trade and the exploitation of the European working class. But we have learned our lesson, and if we just wait a little longer and allow the pie to grow a little bigger, everybody will receive a fatter slice. The division of spoils will never be equitable, but there will be enough to satisfy every man, woman and child – even in the Congo.\n\nThere are, indeed, some positive signs.

Since the two cultures are so different, and since many Muslim immigrants are unwilling (and perhaps unable) to adopt Western values, they should not be allowed to enter, lest they foment internal conflicts and corrode European democracy and liberalism. Such culturist arguments are fed by scientific studies in the humanities and social sciences that highlight the so-called clash of civilisations and the fundamental differences between different cultures. Not all historians and anthropologists accept these theories or support their political usages. But whereas biologists today have an easy time disavowing racism, simply explaining that the biological differences between present-day human populations are trivial, it is harder for historians and anthropologists to disavow culturism.

If you blindly move through the day, trying to accomplish tasks from a list whenever it seems like you have some free time, you will get very little done. Here is a better way to take control of your schedule: Every morning, before your first class, rip a sheet of paper out of your notebook. Go down the left-hand margin marking the waking hours of the day using every other line as a guide. Now block out the hours you will be in class. Then block out the hours you will be eating meals, and when you will be in meetings or other scheduled events. The white space that remains represents the free time that you have available to work with for the day. This is a great way to visualize your schedule. Now, start partitioning this free time into one-hour increments, and assign these blocks to specific projects and assignments. Set aside at least one block for accomplishing small chores or errands. Next to this space write a small to-do list of the little tasks you need to get done that day. This ensures that even when you have huge projects to work on, the little tasks that keep your world running—buying toothpaste or returning library books— will not be neglected. Keep this sheet with you and reference it throughout the day to guide your work habits. If you get knocked off schedule, which will happen frequently, simply take out your sheet at the next available calm moment and spend half a minute reorganizing your time for the remaining hours of the day. This approach only takes two paragraphs to explain, and just minutes a day to implement, but it is exponentially more effective than daily to-do lists.

        "body": "Instead, you want to be self-assured, proud, and modest all at the same time. These are the traits of a well-liked, successful student.\n\nOne good technique for bolstering your confidence is mastering a skill. Develop a skill you can be known for. Again, this is not about bragging rights. People can know you are good at something without you having to constantly remind them. This is about reinforcing your identity and sense of self-confidence.\n\nWhy is this so important? Because college is an overwhelming social environment. You are thrown into a small space with thousands of other students who know nothing about you. Many students fail to maintain a strong sense of identity in this situation, and instead begin to peg their self-worth on receiving the respect and admiration of others. If you're invited to a hot party, do well on a test, or catch the eye of that cute girl ahead of you in the lunch line, you feel good about yourself. But if you end up with no plans for Friday night, bomb a test, or realize that the cute girl was actually smiling at her bodybuilder boyfriend standing right behind you, well, then you feel pretty lousy. The state of your self-esteem is like a roller-coaster ride, differing from day to day depending on events beyond your control. You cannot win at college with this mind-set.\n\nWhen you are dependent on good things happening to make you feel good, your life becomes centered on preserving a good mood. This will constrain you, because if you are constantly worried about avoiding anything negative, you will never do anything out of the ordinary. Standout students, on the other hand, do very little that is ordinary. This is what makes them so phenomenal. They find better ways, uncover new approaches, and question everything. The only way to develop such an aggressive mind-set is to have a strong sense of self-confidence to back you up.\n\nDeveloping these traits is not easy. But doing one thing better than anyone else you know is an excellent start toward accomplishing this goal. By mastering one activity in your life, you are putting a stake into the ground, giving yourself one thing to feel sure of, and making a declaration about who you are. Don't let others dictate how you should feel about yourself; strengthen your identity— then go conquer your world.\"",

Scientists themselves are not always aware of the political, economic and religious interests that control the flow of money; many scientists do, in fact, act out of pure intellectual curiosity. However, only rarely do scientists dictate the scientific agenda.\n\nEven if we wanted to finance pure science unaffected by political, economic or religious interests, it would probably be impossible. Our resources are limited, after all. Ask a congressman to allocate an additional million dollars to the National Science Foundation for basic research, and he’ll justifiably ask whether that money wouldn’t be better used to fund teacher training or to give a needed tax break to a troubled factory in his district. To channel limited resources we must answer questions such as ‘What is more important?’ and ‘What is good?’ And these are not scientific questions. Science can explain what exists in the world, how things work, and what might be in the future. By definition, it has no pretensions to knowing what should be in the future. Only religions and ideologies seek to answer such questions. Consider the following quandary: two biologists from the same department, possessing the same professional skills, have both applied for a million-dollar grant to finance their current research projects. Professor Slughorn wants to study a disease that infects the udders of cows, causing a 10 per cent decrease in their milk production. Professor Sprout wants to study whether cows suffer mentally when they are separated from their calves. Assuming that the amount of money is limited, and that it is impossible to finance both research projects, which one should be funded? There is no scientific answer to this question. There are only political, economic and religious answers. In today’s world, it is obvious that Slughorn has a better chance of getting the money. Not because udder diseases are scientifically more interesting than bovine mentality, but because the dairy industry, which stands to benefit from the research, has more political and economic clout than the animal-rights lobby. Perhaps in a strict Hindu society, where cows are sacred, or in a society committed to animal rights, Professor Sprout would have a better shot. But as long as she lives in a society that values the commercial potential of milk and the health of its human citizens over the feelings of cows, she’d best write up her research proposal so as to appeal to those assumptions. For example, she might write that ‘Depression leads to a decrease in milk production. If we understand the mental world of dairy cows, we could develop psychiatric medication that will improve their mood, thus raising milk production by up to 10 per cent. I estimate that there is a global annual market of $250 million for bovine psychiatric medications.’\n\nScience is unable to set its own priorities. It is also incapable of determining what to do with its discoveries. For example, from a purely scientific viewpoint it is unclear what we should do with our increasing understanding of genetics. Should we use this knowledge to cure cancer, to create a race of genetically engineered supermen, or to engineer dairy cows with super-sized udders? It is obvious that a liberal government, a Communist government, a Nazi government and a capitalist business corporation would use the very same scientific discovery for completely different purposes, and there is no scientific reason to prefer one usage over others. In short, scientific research can flourish only in alliance with some religion or ideology. The ideology justifies the costs of the research. In exchange, the ideology influences the scientific agenda and determines what to do with the discoveries. Hence in order to comprehend how humankind has reached Alamogordo and the moon – rather than any number of alternative destinations – it is not enough to survey the achievements of physicists, biologists and sociologists. We have to take into account the ideological, political and economic forces that shaped physics, biology and sociology, pushing them in certain directions while neglecting others.\"",

If we are talking about theist religions, this is largely correct. But if we take into consideration natural-law religions, then modernity turns out to be an age of intense religious fervour, unparalleled missionary efforts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.\n\nIslam is of course different from Communism, because Islam sees the superhuman order governing the world as the edict of an omnipotent creator god, whereas Soviet Communism did not believe in gods. But Buddhism too gives short shrift to gods, and yet we commonly classify it as a religion. Like Buddhists, Communists believed in a superhuman order of natural and immutable laws that should guide human actions. Whereas Buddhists believe that the law of nature was discovered by Siddhartha Gautama, Communists believed that the law of nature was discovered by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The similarity does not end there. Like other religions, Communism too has its holy scripts and prophetic books, such as Marx’s Das Kapital, which foretold that history would soon end with the inevitable victory of the proletariat. Communism had its holidays and festivals, such as the First of May and the anniversary of the October Revolution. It had theologians adept at Marxist dialectics, and every unit in the Soviet army had a chaplain, called a commissar, who monitored the piety of soldiers and officers. Communism had martyrs, holy wars and heresies, such as Trotskyism. Soviet Communism was a fanatical and missionary religion. A devout Communist could not be a Christian or a Buddhist, and was expected to spread the gospel of Marx and Lenin even at the price of his or her life.\n\nSome readers may feel very uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. If it makes you feel better, you are free to go on calling Communism an ideology rather than a religion. It makes no difference. We can divide creeds into god-centred religions and godless ideologies that claim to be based on natural laws. But then, to be consistent, we would need to catalogue at least some Buddhist, Daoist and Stoic sects as ideologies rather than religions. Conversely, we should note that belief in gods persists within many modern ideologies, and that some of them, most notably liberalism, make little sense without this belief.\"",

He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is. This law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by Buddhists as a universal law of nature. That ‘suffering arises from craving’ is always and everywhere true, just as in modern physics E always equals mc2. Buddhists are people who believe in this law and make it the fulcrum of all their activities. Belief in gods, on the other hand, is of minor importance to them.\n\nThe first principle of monotheist religions is ‘God exists. What does He want from me?’ The first principle of Buddhism is ‘Suffering exists. How do I escape it?’ Buddhism does not deny the existence of gods – they are described as powerful beings who can bring rains and victories – but they have no influence on the law that suffering arises from craving.

        "body": "Suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.\n\nThe central figure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha Gautama. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was heir to a small Himalayan kingdom, sometime around 500 BC. The young prince was deeply affected by the suffering evident all around him. He saw that men and women, children and old people, all suffer not just from occasional calamities such as war and plague, but also from anxiety, frustration and discontent, all of which seem to be an inseparable part of the human condition. People pursue wealth and power, acquire knowledge and possessions, beget sons and daughters, and build houses and palaces. Yet no matter what they achieve, they are never content. Those who live in poverty dream of riches. Those who have a million want two million. Those who have two million want 10 million. Even the rich and famous are rarely satisfied. They too are haunted by ceaseless cares and worries, until sickness, old age and death put a bitter end to them. Everything that one has accumulated vanishes like smoke. Life is a pointless rat race. But how to escape it? At the age of twenty-nine Gautama slipped away from his palace in the middle of the night, leaving behind his family and possessions. He travelled as a homeless vagabond throughout northern India, searching for a way out of suffering. He visited ashrams and sat at the feet of gurus but nothing liberated him entirely – some dissatisfaction always remained. He did not despair. He resolved to investigate suffering on his own until he found a method for complete liberation. He spent six years meditating on the essence, causes and cures for human anguish. In the end he came to the realisation that suffering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind. Gautama’s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatisfied and restless. This is very clear when we experience unpleasant things, such as pain. As long as the pain continues, we are dissatisfied and do all we can to avoid it. Yet even when we experience pleasant things we are never content. We either fear that the pleasure might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify. People dream for years about finding love but are rarely satisfied when they find it. Some become anxious that their partner will leave; others feel that they have settled cheaply, and could have found someone better.\n\nGreat gods can send us rain, social institutions can provide justice and good health care, and lucky coincidences can turn us into millionaires, but none of them can change our basic mental patterns. Hence even the greatest kings are doomed to live in angst, constantly fleeing grief and anguish, forever chasing after greater pleasures. Gautama found that there was a way to exit this vicious circle. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind. But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is, without craving. These practices train the mind to focus all its attention on the question, ‘What am I experiencing now?’ rather than on ‘What would I rather be experiencing?’ It is difficult to achieve this state of mind, but not impossible. Gautama grounded these meditation techniques in a set of ethical rules meant to make it easier for people to focus on actual experience and to avoid falling into cravings and fantasies. He instructed his followers to avoid killing, promiscuous sex and theft, since such acts necessarily stoke the fire of craving (for power, for sensual pleasure, or for wealth). When the flames are completely extinguished, craving is replaced by a state of perfect contentment and serenity, known as nirvana (the literal meaning of which is ‘extinguishing the fire’). Those who have attained nirvana are fully liberated from all suffering. They experience reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions. While they will most likely still encounter unpleasantness and pain, such experiences cause them no misery. A person who does not crave cannot suffer.\"",

        "body": "'Why is there evil in the world? Why is there suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people?’ Monotheists have to practise intellectual gymnastics to explain how an all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the world. One well-known explanation is that this is God’s way of allowing for human free will. Were there no evil, humans could not choose between good and evil, and hence there would be no free will. This, however, is a non-intuitive answer that immediately raises a host of new questions. Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed choose evil and, according to the standard monotheist account, this choice must bring divine punishment in its wake. If God knew in advance that a particular person would use her free will to choose evil, and that as a result she would be punished for this by eternal tortures in hell, why did God create her? Theologians have written countless books to answer such questions. Some find the answers convincing. Some don’t. What’s undeniable is that monotheists have a hard time dealing with the Problem of Evil.\n\nFor dualists, it’s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people because the world is not governed single-handedly by a good God. There is an independent evil power loose in the world. The evil power does bad things.\n\nDualism has its own drawbacks. While solving the Problem of Evil, it is unnerved by the Problem of Order. If the world was created by a single God, it’s clear why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing this cosmic war? Two rival states can fight one another because both obey the same laws of physics. A missile launched from Pakistan can hit targets in India because gravity works the same way in both countries. When Good and Evil fight, what common laws do they obey, and who decreed these laws?\n\nSo, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.\n\nJewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous dualist beliefs and practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what we call ‘monotheism’ are, in fact, dualist in origin and spirit. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in a powerful evil force – like the one Christians call the Devil or Satan – who can act independently, fight against the good God, and wreak havoc without God’s permission. How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is impossible. Either you believe in a single omnipotent God or you believe in two opposing powers, neither of which is omnipotent. Still, humans have a wonderful capacity to believe in contradictions. So it should not come as a surprise that millions of pious Christians, Muslims and Jews manage to believe at one and the same time in an omnipotent God and an independent Devil. Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews have gone so far as to imagine that the good God even needs our help in its struggle against the Devil, which inspired among other things the call for jihads and crusades.\n\nMonotheists could not help but be captivated by dualist dichotomies, precisely because they helped them address the problem of evil. So such oppositions eventually became cornerstones of Christian and Muslim thought. Belief in heaven (the realm of the good god) and hell (the realm of the evil god) was also dualist in origin. There is no trace of this belief in the Old Testament, which also never claims that the souls of people continue to live after the death of the body.\n\nIn fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from different sources. It’s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.\"",

Since monotheists have usually believed that they are in possession of the entire message of the one and only God, they have been compelled to discredit all other religions. Over the last two millennia, monotheists repeatedly tried to strengthen their hand by violently exterminating all competition.\n\nYet just as animism continued to survive within polytheism, so polytheism continued to survive within monotheism. In theory, once a person believes that the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, what’s the point in worshipping partial powers? Who would want to approach a lowly bureaucrat when the president’s office is open to you? Indeed, monotheist theology tends to deny the existence of all gods except the supreme God, and to pour hellfire and brimstone over anyone who dares worship them.\n\nYet there has always been a chasm between theological theories and historical realities. Most people have found it difficult to digest the monotheist idea fully. They have continued to divide the world into ‘we’ and ‘they’, and to see the supreme power of the universe as too distant and alien for their mundane needs. The monotheist religions expelled the gods through the front door with a lot of fanfare, only to take them back in through the side window. Christianity, for example, developed its own pantheon of saints, whose cults differed little from those of the polytheistic gods.\n\nJust as the god Jupiter defended Rome and Huitzilopochtli protected the Aztec Empire, so every Christian kingdom had its own patron saint who helped it overcome difficulties and win wars. England was protected by St George, Scotland by St Andrew, Hungary by St Stephen, and France had St Martin. Cities and towns, professions, and even diseases – each had their own saint. The city of Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian protected chimney cleaners, whereas St Mathew lent a hand to tax collectors in distress. If you suffered from headaches you had to pray to St Agathius, but if from toothaches, then St Apollonia was a much better audience.\n\nThe Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often they were these very same gods in disguise. For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in Catholic Ireland.\"",

The Greeks did not waste any sacrifices on Fate, and Hindus built no temples to Atman. The only reason to approach the supreme power of the universe would be to renounce all desires and embrace the bad along with the good – to embrace even defeat, poverty, sickness and death. Thus some Hindus, known as Sadhus or Sannyasis, devote their lives to uniting with Atman, thereby achieving enlightenment. They strive to see the world from the viewpoint of this fundamental principle, to realise that from its eternal perspective all mundane desires and fears are meaningless and ephemeral phenomena.\"\n\nThe insight of polytheism is conducive to far-reaching religious tolerance. Since polytheists believe, on the one hand, in one supreme and completely disinterested power, and on the other hand in many partial and biased powers, there is no difficulty for the devotees of one god to accept the existence and efficacy of other gods.

When the Christians vehemently refused to do so, and went on to reject all attempts at compromise, the Romans reacted by persecuting what they understood to be a politically subversive faction. And even this was done half-heartedly. In the 300 years from the crucifixion of Christ to the conversion of Emperor Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no more than four general persecutions of Christians. Local administrators and governors incited some anti-Christian violence of their own. Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.1 In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion.\n\nThe religious wars between Catholics and Protestants that swept Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are particularly notorious. All those involved accepted Christ’s divinity and His gospel of compassion and love. However, they disagreed about the nature of this love. Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds. Protestants refused to accept this, arguing that this quid pro quo belittles God’s greatness and love. Whoever thinks that entry to heaven depends upon his or her own good deeds magnifies his own importance, and implies that Christ’s suffering on the cross and God’s love for humankind are not enough.\n\nThese theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the hundreds of thousands. On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God’s love for humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours. When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned Giorgio Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican’s rooms with a fresco of the massacre (the room is currently off-limits to visitors).2 More Christians were killed by fellow Christians in those twenty-four hours than by the polytheistic Roman Empire throughout its entire existence.\"",

        "title": "\"A small, insignificant mountain town called Numantia, inhabited by the peninsula’s native Celts, had dared to throw off the Roman yoke.",
        "body": "Rome at the time was the unquestioned master of the entire Mediterranean basin, having vanquished the Macedonian and Seleucid empires, subjugated the proud city states of Greece, and turned Carthage into a smouldering ruin. The Numantians had nothing on their side but their fierce love of freedom and their inhospitable terrain. Yet they forced legion after legion to surrender or retreat in shame.\n\nEventually, in 134 BC, Roman patience snapped. The Senate decided to send Scipio Aemilianus, Rome’s foremost general and the man who had levelled Carthage, to take care of the Numantians. He was given a massive army of more than 30,000 soldiers. Scipio, who respected the fighting spirit and martial skill of the Numantians, preferred not to waste his soldiers in unnecessary combat. Instead, he encircled Numantia with a line of fortifications, blocking the town’s contact with the outside world. Hunger did his work for him. After more than a year, the food supply ran out. When the Numantians realised that all hope was lost, they burned down their town; according to Roman accounts, most of them killed themselves so as not to become Roman slaves.\n\nNumantia later became a symbol of Spanish independence and courage. Miguel de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote, wrote a tragedy called The Siege of Numantia which ends with the town’s destruction, but also with a vision of Spain’s future greatness. Poets composed paeans to its fierce defenders and painters committed majestic depictions of the siege to canvas. In 1882, its ruins were declared a national monument’ and became a pilgrimage site for Spanish patriots. In the 1950s and 1960s, the most popular comic books in Spain weren’t about Superman and Spiderman – they told of the adventures of El Jabato, an imaginary ancient Iberian hero who fought against the Roman oppressors. The ancient Numantians are to this day Spain’s paragons of heroism and patriotism, cast as role models for the country’s young people. Yet Spanish patriots extol the Numantians in Spanish – a romance language that is a progeny of Scipio’s Latin. The Numantians spoke a now dead and lost Celtic language. Cervantes wrote The Siege of Numantia in Latin script, and the play follows Graeco-Roman artistic models. Numantia had no theatres. Spanish patriots who admire Numantian heroism tend also to be loyal followers of the Roman Catholic Church – don’t miss that first word – a church whose leader still sits in Rome and whose God prefers to be addressed in Latin. Similarly, modern Spanish law derives from Roman law; Spanish politics is built on Roman foundations; and Spanish cuisine and architecture owe a far greater debt to Roman legacies than to those of the Celts of Iberia. Nothing is really left of Numantia save ruins. Even its story has reached us thanks only to the writings of Roman historians. It was tailored to the tastes of Roman audiences which relished tales of freedom-loving barbarians. The victory of Rome over Numantia was so complete that the victors co-opted the very memory of the vanquished. It’s not our kind of story. We like to see underdogs win. But there is no justice in history. Most past cultures have sooner or later fallen prey to the armies of some ruthless empire, which have consigned them to oblivion. Empires, too, ultimately fall, but they tend to leave behind rich and enduring legacies. Almost all people in the twenty-first century are the offspring of one empire or another.\"",

Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.\n\nMoney has a darker side. For although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour – we trust the coin they hold. If they run out of coins, we run out of trust.

From such a vantage point it becomes crystal clear that history is moving relentlessly towards unity.\n\nThe sectioning of Christianity and the collapse of the Mongol Empire are just speed bumps on history’s highway. The best way to appreciate the general direction of history is to count the number of separate human worlds that coexisted at any given moment on planet Earth.

        "body": "Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality. The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.\n\nContemporary American politics also revolve around this contradiction. Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means raising taxes to fund programmes to help the poor, elderly and infirm. But that infringes on the freedom of individuals to spend their money as they wish. Why should the government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put my kids through college? Republicans, on the other hand, want to maximise individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health care. Just as medieval culture did not manage to square chivalry with Christianity, so the modern world fails to square liberty with equality. But this is no defect. Such contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture’s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, reevaluate and criticise.

I cannot think: I have no longer any feeling for the beauties of nature, and books are distasteful to me. Once we give ourselves up, we are totally lost.\n\nUnhappy being that I am! Why do I thus deceive myself? What is to come of all this wild, aimless, endless passion? I cannot pray except to her. My imagination sees nothing but her: all surrounding objects are of no account, except as they relate to her. In this dreamy state I enjoy many happy hours, till at length I feel compelled to tear myself away from her. Ah, Wilhelm, to what does not my heart often compel me! When I have spent several hours in her company, till I feel completely absorbed by her figure, her grace, the divine expression of her thoughts, my mind becomes gradually excited to the highest excess, my sight grows dim, my hearing confused, my breathing oppressed as if by the hand of a murderer, and my beating heart seeks to obtain relief for my aching senses. I am sometimes unconscious whether I really exist. If in such moments I find no sympathy, and Charlotte does not allow me to enjoy the melancholy consolation of bathing her hand with my tears, I feel compelled to tear myself from her, when I either wander through the country, climb some precipitous cliff, or force a path through the trackless thicket, where I am lacerated and torn by thorns and briers; and thence I find relief. Sometimes I lie stretched on the ground, overcome with fatigue and dying with thirst; sometimes, late in the night, when the moon shines above me, I recline against an aged tree in some sequestered forest, to rest my weary limbs, when, exhausted and worn, I sleep till break of day.

At length the warmth of her nature is influenced by certain new and unknown wishes. Inflamed by the flatteries of men, her former pleasures become by degrees insipid, till at length she meets with a youth to whom she is attracted by an indescribable feeling; upon him she now rests all her hopes; she forgets the world around her; she sees, hears, desires nothing but him, and him only.\n\nHe alone occupies all her thoughts. Uncorrupted by the idle indulgence of an enervating vanity, her affection moving steadily toward its object, she hopes to become his, and to realise, in an everlasting union with him, all that happiness which she sought, all that bliss for which she longed. His repeated promises confirm her hopes: embraces and endearments, which increase the ardour of her desires, overmaster her soul. She floats in a dim, delusive anticipation of her happiness; and her feelings become excited to their utmost tension. She stretches out her arms finally to embrace the object of all her wishes and her lover forsakes her. Stunned and bewildered, she stands upon a precipice. All is darkness around her. No prospect, no hope, no consolation—forsaken by him in whom her existence was centred! She sees nothing of the wide world before her, thinks nothing of the many individuals who might supply the void in her heart; she feels herself deserted, forsaken by the world; and, blinded and impelled by the agony which wrings her soul, she plunges into the deep, to end her sufferings in the broad embrace of death. See here, Albert, the history of thousands; and tell me, is not this a case of physical infirmity? Nature has no way to escape from the labyrinth: her powers are exhausted: she can contend no longer, and the poor soul must die. \"Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim, 'The foolish girl! she should have waited; she should have allowed time to wear off the impression; her despair would have been softened, and she would have found another lover to comfort her.'

When a nation, which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at last and throws off its chains, do you call that weakness? The man who, to rescue his house from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, so that he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of excitement, he could scarcely move; he who, under the rage of an insult, attacks and puts to flight half a score of his enemies, are such persons to be called weak? My good friend, if resistance be strength, how can the highest degree of resistance be a weakness?\" Albert looked steadfastly at me, and said, \"Pray forgive me, but I do not see that the examples you have adduced bear any relation to the question.\" \"Very likely,\" I answered; \"for I have often been told that my style of illustration borders a little on the absurd. But let us see if we cannot place the matter in another point of view, by inquiring what can be a man's state of mind who resolves to free himself from the burden of life,—a burden often so pleasant to bear,—for we cannot otherwise reason fairly upon the subject. \"Human nature,\" I continued, \"has its limits. It is able to endure a certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated as soon as this measure is exceeded. The question, therefore, is, not whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to endure the measure of his sufferings. The suffering may be moral or physical; and in my opinion it is just as absurd to call a man a coward who destroys himself, as to call a man a coward who dies of a malignant fever.\" \"Paradox, all paradox!\" exclaimed Albert. \"Not so paradoxical as you imagine,\" I replied. \"You allow that we designate a disease as mortal when nature is so severely attacked, and her strength so far exhausted, that she cannot possibly recover her former condition under any change that may take place. \"Now, my good friend, apply this to the mind; observe a man in his natural, isolated condition; consider how ideas work, and how impressions fasten on him, till at length a violent passion seizes him, destroying all his powers of calm reflection, and utterly ruining him. \"It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands the condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him.

        "body": "Colonel Stas Preczewski, coach of the army crew team at West Point a few years ago, faced a baffling problem. Through extensive testing he had determined the strengths and abilities of every rower on his team. He had measured each man’s power on ergometers and had composed crews in every possible combination in order to calculate each member’s contribution. He was able to rank his rowers objectively and precisely from best to worst. He then put the eight best in his varsity boat and the eight others, the weakest, in the junior varsity boat.\n\nThe problem: The JV boat beat the varsity boat two-thirds of the time. The situation is explained in a famous Harvard Business School case, which also notes that the varsity boat was full of resentment over who was contributing most, while the JV rowers, feeling they had nothing to lose, supported one another happily. But the case doesn’t tell how Coach Preczewski solved his problem. One day he lined up the varsity crew in four pairs. He told them they were to wrestle for ninety seconds. Only rule: no punching. “It was like the WWF,” he recalls. When he stopped them, he noticed that no one was winning. Each man was discovering that his opponent was just as strong and determined as he was. Preczewski then had them change opponents and wrestle again. By the third round they were choosing their own opponents—“One guy would point at another and say,‘You!’” Preczewski says. On the fourth or fifth round, one of the rowers started laughing, and they all piled into a general brawl. Eventually someone said, “Coach, can we go row now?” From then on the varsity boat fl ew, and made it to the semifinals in the national tournament. You probably can’t order members of an executive team to wrestle, tempting though it may be. But there are other ways to discharge tensions that are crippling a group. These conflicts are the flip side of competing agendas; instead of being focused on the future, they typically linger from the past. Bringing them out into the open and then resolving them is one of the team leader’s most important jobs. Doing it is an important element of dealing with a more general threat to team performance. . . . Unwillingness to face the real issues. The usual metaphor is the elephant in the room. Former Eli Lilly CEO Randall Tobias called it the moose on the table. George Kohlrieser, a professor at the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland, has developed the metaphor particularly well: “Put the fish on the table,” he says.

        "body": "The person of short stature is surely aware of our cultural bias for the taller person. Short = child/weak; tall = adult/ strong; etc. If you don’t deal with this successfully, you are possibly facing frustration, lowered self-esteem, a lack of career progression, and sometimes depression. I want to tell you about the amazing Julie who went from being a speech therapist for a major rehabilitation provider to being the director of all rehabilitation services in the company. Her “problem” was that she was four-eleven and cute as the dickens. But she had three other characteristics in the mix: she was smart, she was focused on her goals, and she assumed responsibility for her impact (demeanor, appearance, and verbal communication). A deliberate and businesslike demeanor came to her easily, and she learned to act as if she were tall and successful.\n\n**Nonverbal Communication**\n\nCarriage: Posture must be upright, quasi-military. Don’t have an inch that you relinquish to gravity. Get feedback about your carriage from friends or a video of you walking normally. Imagine a crown on your head that you hold up proudly. Head control is extremely important in establishing a mature, dignified demeanor. Don’t we talk about being “levelheaded”? Make even your nodding purposeful.\n\nA person who holds himself up will appear to be confident and adult. Step back a pace from face-to-face interactions with tall persons so you don’t distort your posture by craning your neck uncomfortably.\n\nClothing, another nonverbal cue, can make a huge difference in your physical impact. Fit is crucial here. Do not appear in any clothes that are too big for you or ill-fi tting in any way; it would really send the message of childwearing-adult-clothes. If you have any money to spend, spend it on tailoring.\n\nIf at all possible, you would be way ahead by consulting a wardrobe and image expert to help you select colors and styles that complement your personal style, flatter your physique, and set you off as “very well dressed.” They also know where you are likely to find suitable choices for your professional presentations. A personal tailor can make the stylish and well-fi tted wardrobe you need. Both men and women should avoid cuffed trousers (or any strong horizontal lines).Men, make sure your tie doesn’t hang down below your belt. In most human interactions, the dimensions of your character and self-respect will matter more than physical stature as people get to know you. But your carriage and wardrobe function importantly in first impressions.\n\n**Vocal Communication**\n\nYou may be short, but that doesn’t mean that your voice has to sound small. You should have a mature voice with adult intonations. We all know that a high voice is associated with a small body (i.e., a child). Because you are very aware of this, you may try to push your voice down to the very bottom of your range. This just makes you sound desperate, and your voice will not sound good at all. Use more simple declarative sentences when you talk . Avoid stringing sentences together with conjunctions: “I went to see him and he said he didn’t care so I told him the whole story, but … blah, blah,” and on and on. Here’s a stronger version: “I wentto see him. He said he didn’t care. I told him the whole story.” The shorter your phrases, the more emphatic your speech will be. Read these two versions out loud to experience the great difference in maturity. Avoid extreme fluctuation in your intonation where your voice goes sky high or swoops around in great leaps. This sounds childlike and excitable. Keep your cool and have your melodic line contained—not monotone, but contained. Present yourself as someone in authority, expecting respect. This means a more serious demeanor. Julie’s assurance stemmed from her confidence in her training, so she projected professionalism right from the beginning.\n\nBe deliberate in your movement, in your language selection, and especially in your speech rate. Rushing is for those who meet the schedules of other people. Hurried speech is a form of deference, and it is also frequently hard to understand. Do not let events or personalities make you speak rapidly; you need to be “above” such excitation. Energy and precise articulation reveal commitment to the message. That’s why you don’t have to “hype it” with empty intensifi ers (it’s very, very important!). Just the way you say it with deliberate and clear articulation communicates its importance.\n\nAvoid superlatives: “Fantastic! Terrific! Adorable! You were just great! I loved the way you handled that!” These expressions make you sound like an undiscriminating teenager (see “Words Fail Me!”). Exercise a cooler judgment and make your highest praise a little harder to get. Higher standards reveal more mature range of experience.\n\nDemeanor: Pursue graciousness as a characteristic. You want to recognize virtue in subordinates and avoid speaking ill of others. To blame is to claim helplessness, which you do not want. But do defend your leadership turf:\n\n• Do not let yourself be perceived as “cute” or\n   “amusing.”\n• Do not let yourself be interrupted.\n• Do not respond to distractions.\n\nSo if you are short, keep your carriage, demeanor, and statements contained (in verbiage, vocabulary, and melody) and you will be perceived as bigger. That’s how it works.\"",

        "title": "\"While it’s clear that extensive deliberate practice will make someone a  superior surgeon or billiard player or public speaker, it’s natural to wonder if the effect can be understood in some general way.",
        "body": "Beyond simply making a person better at the specific task they’re practicing, is it doing something that applies across cases? The answer is yes, and it’s worth identifying because it’s the opposite of what most people think. If you’re a golf fan, you may have seen videotape of Tiger Woods in a particular situation that has occurred a few times in his career. He’s in a tournament, standing over the ball, about to hit his shot. At some moment after he has begun his swing but before he has hit the ball, a major distraction happens—a fan yells, someone moves sharply, the crowd roars elsewhere on the course. Woods stops himself in mid-swing, steps back from the ball, recomposes himself, and then steps forward and hits the shot. Ordinary golfers respond with awe when they see this happen because they know what they’d do in the same circumstance: Unable to stop their swing once they’d started it, they would carry through and hit a terrible shot or maybe miss the ball completely. Why is this significant? Frequently when we see great performers doing what they do, it strikes us that they’ve practiced for so long, and done it so many times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, what they have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically. When we learn to do anything new—how to drive, for example—we go through three stages. The first stage demands a lot of attention as we try out the controls, learn the rules of driving, and so on. In the second stage we begin to coordinate our knowledge, linking movements together and more fluidly combining our actions with our knowledge of the car, the situation, and the rules. In the third stage we drive the car with barely a thought. It’s automatic. And with that our improvement at driving slows dramatically, eventually stopping completely. For most of the things we do, including driving, that’s not a problem. We don’t need to be great at such things, just good enough to carry on with our lives. That category of activities includes golf for most people who play the game. They don’t need to earn a living at it; they just want to be able to have fun with it. Not having to devote much thought to such activities is a blessing, since it frees our minds to focus on other matters that we consider more important. But it does mean that our brains have pretty much checked out when we’re doing these things. By contrast, great performers never allow themselves to reach the automatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen fi eld. That is the effect of continual deliberate practice—avoiding automaticity. The essence of practice, which is constantly trying to do the things one cannot do comfortably, makes automatic behavior impossible. It’s certainly true that a great performer is able to do many things in his or her fi eld with far fewer mental demands than a novice performer; an excellent pilot lands a 747 without breaking a sweat.\n\nBut ultimately the performance is always conscious and controlled, not automatic. Avoiding automaticity through continual practice is another way of saying that great performers are always getting better. This is why the most devoted can stay at the top of their field for far longer than most people would think possible.\"",

        "title": "\"What Deliberate Practice Is and Isn’t",
        "body": "Deliberate practice is activity designed specifically to improve performance, often with a teacher’s help; it can be repeated a lot; feedback on results is continuously available; it’s highly demanding mentally, whether the activity is purely intellectual, such as chess or business-related activities, or heavily physical, such as sports; and it isn’t much fun.\n\nIt’s designed specifically to improve performance.\n\nThe key word in this attribute is designed. e. In some fields, especially intellectual ones such as the arts, science, and business, people may eventually become skilled enough to design their own practice. It’s apparent why becoming significantly good at almost anything is extremely difficult without the help of a teacher or coach, at least in the early going. Without a clear, unbiased view of the subject’s performance, choosing the best practice activity will be impossible; for reasons that may be simply physical (as in sports) or deeply psychological very few of us can make a clear, honest assessment of our own performance. Even if we could, we could not design the best practice activity for that moment in our development—the type of practice that would put us on the road to achieving at the highest levels—unless we had extensive knowledge of the latest and best methods for developing people in our chosen field. Most of us don’t have that knowledge. Deliberate practice requires that one identify certain sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, and then work intently on them. Tiger Woods has been seen to drop golf balls into a sand trap and step on them, then practice shots from that near impossible lie. The great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects of what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved; then it’s on to the next aspect. Choosing these aspects of performance is itself an important skill. The point is illustrated by drawing three concentric circles. The inner circle “comfort zone,” the middle one “learning zone,” and the outer one “panic zone.” Only by choosing activities in the learning zone can one make progress. That’s the location of skills and abilities that are just out of reach. We can never make progress in the comfort zone because those are the activities we can already do easily, while panic-zone activities are so hard that we don’t even know how to approach them. Identifying the learning zone, which is not simple, and then forcing oneself to stay continually in it as it changes, which is even harder— these are the first and most important characteristics of deliberate practice.\n\nIt can be repeated a lot.\n\nHigh repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts. Tiger Woods may face that buried lie in the sand only two or three times in a season, and if those were his only opportunities to work on hitting that shot, he certainly wouldn’t be able to hit it very well. Repeating a specific activity over and over is what most of us mean by practice, yet for most of us it isn’t especially effective. Two points distinguish deliberate practice from what most of us actually do. One is the choice of a properly demanding activity in the learning zone, as discussed. The other is the amount of repetition. Top performers repeat their practice activities to stultifying extent. Ted Williams, baseball’s greatest hitter, would practice hitting until his hands bled. Pete Maravich, whose college basketball records still stand after more than thirty years, would go to the gym when it opened in the morning and shoot baskets until it closed at night. More generally, the most effective deliberate practice activities are those that can be repeated at high volume.\n\nFeedback on results is continuously available.\n\nPracticing without feedback is like bowling through a curtain that hangs down to knee level. You can work on technique all you like, but if you can’t see the effects, two things will happen: You won’t get any better, and you’ll stop caring. Getting feedback on most practice activities is easy. Lift the curtain and a bowler knows immediately how he did; in sports generally, seeing the results of practice is no problem. Aspiring chess masters practice by studying chess games played by the greatest players; at each position, the student chooses a move and then gets feedback by seeing what the champion did. Difficulties arise when the results require interpretation. You may believe you played that bar of the Brahms Violin Concerto perfectly, but can you really trust your own judgment? Or you may think that your rehearsal of a job interview was fl awless, but your opinion isn’t what counts. These are situations in which a teacher, coach, or mentor is vital for providing crucial feedback.\n\nIt’s highly demanding mentally.\n\nDeliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. That is what makes it “deliberate,” as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in. Continually seeking exactly those elements of performance that are unsatisfactory and then trying one’s hardest to make them better places enormous strains on anyone’s mental abilities. The work is so great that it seems no one can sustain it for very long. A finding that is remarkably consistent across disciplines is that four or five hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no more than an hour to ninety minutes. The best violinists in the Berlin study, for example, practiced about three and a half hours a day, typically in two or three sessions. Many other top-level musicians report four or five hours as their upper limit. Chess champions typically report the same amount of practice. Even elite athletes say the factor that limits their practice time is their ability to sustain concentration. Nathan Milstein, one of the twentieth century’s greatest violinists, was a student of the famous teacher Leopold Auer.  As the story goes, Milstein asked Auer if he was practicing enough. Auer responded, “Practice with your fingers and you need all day. Practice with your mind and you will do as much in one and a half hours.” What Auer didn’t add is that it’s a good thing one and a half hours are enough, because if you’re practicing with your mind, you couldn’t possibly keep it up all day.\n\nIt isn’t much fun.\n\nThis follows inescapably from the other characteristics of deliberate practice, which could be described as a recipe for not having fun. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we’re good at, we insistently seek out what we’re not good at. Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those things over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see— or get others to tell us—exactly what still isn’t right so we can repeat the most painful and difficult parts of what we’ve just done. We continue that process until we’re mentally exhausted.\n\nIf it seems a bit depressing that the most important thing you can do to improve performance is no fun, take consolation in this fact: It must be so. If the activities that lead to greatness were easy and fun, then everyone would do them and they would not distinguish the best from the rest. The reality that deliberate practice is hard can even be seen as good news. It means that most people won’t do it. So your willingness to do it will distinguish you all the more\"",

        "body": "All three groups were getting up every morning and putting in the hours, throwing themselves at their chosen career in a fairly committed way with a demanding workweek equal to what a great many people clock in a wide range of fields. The violinists were quite certain which activity was most important for making them better: It was practicing by themselves. When asked to rate the relevance of twelve music-related activities to their progress, solitary practice was number one with a bullet. They all knew it, but they didn’t all do it. The amount of time the various groups actually spent practicing alone differed dramatically. The two top groups, the best and better violinists, practiced by themselves about twenty-four hours a week on average. The third group, the good violinists, practiced by themselves only nine hours a week.\n\nJust as the violinists were sure that it’s the most important activity, they were also quite clear that it’s hard and it isn’t much fun. When they rated activities by effort required, solo practice ranked way harder than playing music for fun, alone or with others, and harder than even the most effortful everyday activity, child care. As for pleasure, practice ranked far below playing for fun and even below formal group performance, which you might reasonably guess would be the most stressful and least fun activity.\n\nPractice is so hard that doing a lot of it requires people to arrange their lives in particular ways. The two top groups of violinists did most of their practicing in the late morning or early afternoon, when they were still fairly fresh. By contrast, violinists in the third group practiced mostly in the late afternoon, when they were more likely to be tired. The two top groups differed from the third group in another way: They slept more. They not only slept more at night, they also took far more afternoon naps. All that practicing seems to demand a lot of recovery.\n\nSo all the violinists understood that practicing by themselves was the most important thing they could do to get better. Though they didn’t consider it easy or fun. The difference was that some chose to practice more, and those violinists were a great deal better.\"",

But the study showed that—at least as most of us understand “talent,” meaning an ability to achieve more easily—they were not.\n\nSpecifically, the researchers studied the results of those nationally administered grade-level exams. You would expect, of course, that the students who went on to win places at the music school—and this was a school whose graduates regularly win national competitions and go on to professional music careers—would reach any given grade level more quickly and easily than the students who ended up being less accomplished. That’s the very meaning of being musically talented. But it didn’t happen. On the contrary: The researchers calculated the average hours of practice needed by the most elite group of students to reach each grade level, and they calculated the average hours needed by each of the other groups. There were no statistically significant differences. For students who ended up going to the elite music school as well as for students who just played casually for fun, it took an average of twelve hundred hours of practice to reach grade 5, for example. The music school students reached grade levels at earlier ages than the other students for the simple reason that they practiced more each day. By age twelve, the researchers found, the students in the most elite group were practicing an average of two hours a day versus about fifteen minutes a day for the students in the lowest group, an 800 pecent difference. So students could put in their hours a little bit each day or a lot each day, but nothing, it turned out, enabled any group to reach any given grade level without putting in those hours. As one of the researchers, Professor John A. Sloboda of the University of Keele, put it: “There is absolutely no evidence of a ‘fast track’ for high achievers.” \"",

Each year, they reaped the rewards of investing: all the earnings growth that those thousands of corporations generated and all the dividends that they distributed. 4 Each family member grew wealthier at the same pace, and all was harmonious. Their investment had compounded over the decades, creating enormous wealth, because the Gotrocks family was playing a winner’s game. But after a while, a few fast-talking Helpers arrive on the scene, and they persuade some “smart” Gotrocks cousins that they can earn a larger share than the other relatives. These Helpers convince the cousins to sell some of their shares in the companies to other family members and to buy some shares of others from them in return. The Helpers handle the transactions, and as brokers, they receive commissions for their services. The ownership is thus rearranged among the family members. To their surprise, however, the family wealth begins to grow at a slower pace. Why? Because some of the return is now consumed by the Helpers, and the family’s share of the generous pie that U.S. industry bakes each year—all those dividends paid, all those earnings reinvested in the business —100 percent at the outset, starts to decline, simply because some of the return is now consumed by the Helpers. To make matters worse, while the family had always paid taxes on their dividends, some of the members are now also paying taxes on the capital gains they realize from their stock-swapping back and forth, further diminishing the family’s total wealth. The smart cousins quickly realize that their plan has actually diminished the rate of growth in the family’s wealth. They recognize that their foray into stock-picking has been a failure and conclude that they need professional assistance, the better to pick the right stocks for themselves. So they hire stock-picking experts—more Helpers!—to gain an advantage. These money managers charge a fee for their services. So when the family appraises its wealth a year later, it finds that its share of the pie has diminished even further. To make matters still worse, the new managers feel compelled to earn their keep by trading the family’s stocks at feverish levels of activity, not only increasing the brokerage commissions paid to the first set of Helpers, but running up the tax bill as well. Now the family’s earlier 100 percent share of the dividend and earnings pie is further diminished. “Well, we failed to pick good stocks for ourselves, and when that didn’t work, we also failed to pick managers who could do so,” the smart cousins say. “What shall we do?” Undeterred by their two previous failures, they decide to hire still more Helpers. They retain the best investment consultants and financial planners they can find to advise them on how to select the right managers, who will then surely pick the right stocks. The consultants, of course, tell them they can do exactly that. “Just pay us a fee for our services,” the new Helpers assure the cousins, “and all will be well.” Alas, the family’s share of the pie tumbles once again.\"",

        "body": "If, like most people, you will be building up your investment portfolio slowly over time with the accretion of yearly savings, you will be taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging. This technique is controversial, but it does help you avoid the risk of putting all your money in the stock or bond market at the wrong time. Don’t be alarmed by the fancy-sounding name. Dollar-cost averaging simply means investing the same fixed amount of money in, for example, the shares of some index mutual fund, at regular intervals—say, every month or quarter—over a long period of time. Periodic investments of equal dollar amounts in common stocks can reduce (but not avoid) the risks of equity investment by ensuring that the entire portfolio of stocks will not be purchased at temporarily inflated prices.\n\nDollar-cost averaging is not a panacea that eliminates the risk of investing in common stocks. It will not save your 401(k) plan from a devastating fall in value during a year such as 2008, because no plan can protect you from a punishing bear market. And you must have both the cash and the confidence to continue making the periodic investments even when the sky is the darkest. No matter how scary the financial news, no matter how difficult it is to see any signs of optimism, you must not interrupt the automatic-pilot nature of the program. Because if you do, you will lose the benefit of buying at least some of your shares after a sharp market decline when they are for sale at low prices. Dollar-cost averaging will give you this bargain: Your average price per share will be lower than the average price at which you bought shares. Why? Because you’ll buy more shares at low prices and fewer at high prices. Some investment advisers are not fans of dollar-cost averaging, because the strategy is not optimal if the market does go straight up. (You would have been better off putting all $5,000 into the market at the beginning of the period.) But it does provide a reasonable insurance policy against poor future stock markets. And it does minimize the regret that inevitably follows if you were unlucky enough to have put all your money into the stock market during a peak period such as March of 2000 or October of 2007. To further illustrate the benefits of dollar-cost averaging, let’s move from a hypothetical to a real example. The following table shows the results (ignoring taxes) of a $500 initial investment made on January 1, 1978, and thereafter $100 per month, in the shares of the Vanguard 500 Index mutual fund. Less than $49,000 was committed to the program. The final value was over $760,000\"",

The results of the administration to the two groups are compared, and the drug is deemed effective only if the group receiving the drug did better than the group getting the placebo. Obviously, if both groups got better in the same period of time, the drug should not be given the credit, even if the patients did recover.\n\nIn the stock-market experiments, the placebo with which the technical strategies are compared is the buy-and-hold strategy. Technical schemes often do make profits, but so does a buy-and-hold strategy. Indeed, a simple buy-and-hold strategy using a portfolio consisting of all the stocks in a broad stock-market index has provided investors with an average annual rate of return of about 10 percent over the past ninety years. Only if technical schemes produce better returns than the market can they be judged effective. To date, none has consistently passed the test\"",

        "body": "To illustrate, let me describe an experiment in which I asked my students to participate. The students were asked to construct a stock chart showing the movements of a hypothetical stock initially selling at $50. For each successive trading day, the closing stock price would be determined by the flip of a coin. If the toss was a head, the students assumed that the stock closed ½ point higher than the preceding close. If the flip was a tail, the price was assumed to be down by ½. The chart below is the hypothetical stock chart derived from one of these experiments.\n\n![Screenshot 2021-10-06 025008.png](:/95a9cf640493ea116aca760d1c2c1818)\n\nThe chart derived from random coin tossings looks remarkably like a normal stock price chart and even appears to display cycles. Of course, the pronounced “cycles” that we seem to observe in coin tossings do not occur at regular intervals as true cycles do, but neither do the ups and downs in the stock market.\n\nIt is this lack of regularity that is crucial. The “cycles” in the stock charts are no more true cycles than the runs of luck or misfortune of the ordinary gambler. And the fact that stocks seem to be in an uptrend, which looks just like the upward move in some earlier period, provides no useful information on the dependability or duration of the current uptrend. Yes, history does tend to repeat itself in the stock market, but in an infinitely surprising variety of ways that confound any attempts to profit from a knowledge of past price patterns.\n\nIn other simulated charts derived from student coin-tossings, there were head-and-shoulders formations, triple tops and bottoms, and other more esoteric patterns. One chart showed an upward breakout from an inverted head and shoulders (a very bullish formation). I showed it to a chartist friend of mine who practically jumped out of his skin. “What is this company?” he exclaimed. “We’ve got to buy immediately. This pattern’s a classic. There’s no question the stock will be up 15 points next week.” He did not respond kindly when I told him the chart had been produced by flipping a coin. \"",

        "body": "The technician believes that knowledge of a stock’s past behavior can help predict its probable future behavior. In other words, the sequence of price changes before any given day is important in predicting the price change for that day. This might be called “the wallpaper principle.” The technical analyst tries to predict future stock prices just as we might predict that the pattern of wallpaper behind the mirror is the same as the pattern above the mirror. The basic premise is that there are repeatable patterns in space and time.\n\nChartists believe momentum exists in the market. Supposedly, stocks that have been rising will continue to do so, and those that begin falling will go on sinking. Investors should therefore buy stocks that start rising and continue to hold their strong stocks. Should the stock begin to fall, investors are advised to sell.\n\nThese technical rules have been tested exhaustively by using stock-price data as far back as the beginning of the twentieth century. The results reveal that past movements in stock prices cannot be used reliably to foretell future movements. The stock market has little, if any, memory. While the market does exhibit some momentum, it does not occur dependably, and there are frequent momentum crashes. There is not enough persistence in stock prices to make trend-following strategies consistently profitable. Although there is some short-term momentum in the stock market, as will be described more fully in chapter 11, any investor who pays transactions costs and taxes is unlikely to benefit from it.\n\nEconomists have also examined the technician’s thesis that there are often sequences of price changes in the same direction over several days (or several weeks or months). Stocks are likened to fullbacks who, once having gained some momentum, can be expected to carry on for a long gain. It turns out that this is simply not the case. Sometimes one gets positive price changes (rising prices) for several days in a row; but sometimes when you are flipping a fair coin you also get a long string of “heads” in a row, and you get sequences of positive (or negative) price changes no more frequently than you can expect random sequences of heads or tails in a row. What are often called “persistent patterns” in the stock market occur no more frequently than the runs of luck in the fortunes of any gambler. This is what economists mean when they say that stock prices behave very much like a random walk.\"",

I personally have never known a successful technician, but I have seen the wrecks of several unsuccessful ones. Curiously, however, the broke technician is never apologetic. If you commit the social error of asking him why he is broke, he will tell you quite ingenuously that he made the all-too-human error of not believing his own charts. To my great embarrassment, I once choked conspicuously at the dinner table when a chartist made such a comment. I have since made it a rule never to eat with a chartist. It’s bad for digestion.\n\nAlthough technicians might not get rich following their own advice, their store of words is precious indeed. Consider this advice offered by one technical service:\n\nThe market’s rise after a period of reaccumulation is a bullish sign. Nevertheless, fulcrum characteristics are not yet clearly present and a resistance area exists 40 points higher in the Dow, so it is clearly premature to say the next leg of the bull market is up. If, in the coming weeks, a test of the lows holds and the market breaks out of its flag, a further rise would be indicated. Should the lows be violated, a continuation of the intermediate term downtrend is called for. In view of the current situation, it is a distinct possibility that traders will sit in the wings awaiting a clearer delineation of the trend and the market will move in a narrow trading range.\n\nIf you ask me what this means, I cannot tell you, but I think the technician probably had the following in mind: “If the market does not go up or go down, it will remain unchanged.” Even the weather forecaster can do better than that.\"",

        "title": "\"One of the largest booms and busts of the late twentieth century involved the Japanese real estate and stock markets.",
        "body": "From 1955 to 1990, the value of Japanese real estate increased more than 75 times. By 1990, the total value of all Japanese property was estimated at nearly $20 trillion—equal to more than 20 percent of the entire world’s wealth and about double the total value of the world’s stock markets. America is twenty-five times bigger than Japan in terms of physical acreage, and yet Japan’s property in 1990 was appraised to be worth five times as much as all American property. Theoretically, the Japanese could have bought all the property in America by selling off metropolitan Tokyo. Just selling the Imperial Palace and its grounds at their appraised value would have raised enough cash to buy all of California. The stock market countered by rising like a helium balloon on a windless day. Stock prices increased 100-fold from 1955 to 1990. At their peak, in December 1989, Japanese stocks had a total market value of about $4 trillion, almost 1.5 times the value of all U.S. equities and close to 45 percent of the world’s equitymarket capitalization. Firm-foundation investors were aghast that Japanese stocks sold at more than 60 times earnings, almost 5 times book value, and more than 200 times dividends. In contrast, U.S. stocks sold at about 15 times earnings, and London equities sold at 12 times earnings. The value of NTT Corporation, Japan’s telephone giant, exceeded the value of AT&T, IBM, Exxon, General Electric, and General Motors put together. Supporters of the stock market had answers to all the logical objections that could be raised. Were price-earnings ratios in the stratosphere? “No,” said the salespeople at Kabuto-cho (Japan’s Wall Street). “Japanese earnings are understated relative to U.S. earnings because depreciation charges are overstated and earnings do not include the earnings of partially owned affiliated firms.” Price-earnings multiples adjusted for these effects would be much lower. Were yields, at well under ½ of 1 percent, unconscionably low? The answer was that this simply reflected the low interest rates at the time in Japan. Was it dangerous that stock prices were five times the value of assets? Not at all. The book values did not reflect the dramatic appreciation of the land owned by Japanese companies. And the high value of Japanese land was “explained” by both the density of Japanese population and the various regulations and tax laws restricting the use of habitable land. In fact, none of the “explanations” could hold water. Even when earnings were adjusted, the multiples were still far higher than in other countries and extraordinarily inflated relative to Japan’s own history. Moreover, Japanese profitability had been declining, and the strong yen was bound to make it more difficult for Japan to export. Although land was scarce in Japan, its manufacturers, such as its auto makers, were finding abundant land for new plants at attractive prices in foreign lands. And rental income had been rising far more slowly than land values, indicating a falling rate of return on real estate. Finally, the low interest rates that had been underpinning the market had already begun to rise in 1989. Much to the distress of those speculators who had concluded that the fundamental laws of financial gravity were not applicable to Japan, Isaac Newton arrived there in 1990. Interestingly, it was the government itself that dropped the apple. The Bank of Japan (Japan’s Federal Reserve) saw the ugly specter of a general inflation stirring amid the borrowing frenzy and the liquidity boom underwriting the rise in land and stock prices. And so the central bank restricted credit and engineered a rise in interest rates. The hope was that further rises in property prices would be choked off and the stock market might be eased downward. The stock market was not eased down; instead, it collapsed. The fall was almost as extreme as the U.S. stock-market crash from the end of 1929 to mid-1932. The Japanese (Nikkei) stock-market index reached a high of almost 40,000 on the last trading day of the 1980s. By mid-August 1992, the index had declined to 14,309, a drop of about 63 percent. The fall in stock prices from 1990 on simply reflected a return to the price-to-book-value relationships that were typical in the early 1980s. The Japanese stock market remained depressed for the next several decades. In March of 2018, the Nikkei index sold at 21,000. The air also rushed out of the real estate balloon during the early 1990s. Various measures of land prices and property values indicate a decline roughly as severe as that of the stock market. The financial laws of gravity know no geographic boundaries.\"",

They're blessed with this marvellous talent, but they can't make the effort to systematize it. They end up squandering it in little bits and pieces. I've seen my share of people like that. At first you think they're amazing. They can sight-read some terrifically difficult piece and do a damn good job playing it all the way through. You see them do it, and you're overwhelmed. You think, \"I could never do that in a million years.' But that's as far as it goes. They can't take it any further. And why not? Because they won't put in the effort. They haven't had the discipline pounded into them. They've been spoiled. They have just enough talent so they've been able to play things well without any effort and they've had people telling them how great they are from an early age, so hard work looks stupid to them. They'll take some piece another kid has to work on for three weeks and polish it off in half the time, so the teacher assumes they've put enough into it and lets them go on to the next thing. And they do that in half the time and go on to the next piece. They never find out what it means to be hammered by the teacher; they lose out on a crucial element required for character building. It's a tragedy.\n\nThe trick to teaching children like that is not to praise them too much. They're so used to praise it doesn't mean anything to them. You've got to dole it out wisely. And you can't force anything on them. You have to let them choose for themselves. And you don't let them rush ahead from one thing to the next: you make them stop and think. But that's about it.

        "body": "1. Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.\n\nWhy is it that many of the adult children of UAWs are more likely to earn high incomes than to accumulate wealth? We believe one of the major reasons is that as children they were constantly told their parents were wealthy. Adult UAWs tend to be the product of parents who lived in ways they thought appropriate for wealthy people to act. They lived the high-status/high-consumption lifestyle so popular in America today. It's no wonder their sons and daughters attempt to emulate them. Conversely, adult PAWs whose parents were wealthy have told us time and time again: I never knew my dad was wealthy until I became executor of his estate. He never looked it.\n\n2. No matter how wealthy you are, teach your children discipline and frugality.\n\nWe profiled Dr. North, a wealthy man whose adult children live frugal, well-disciplined lives. Dr. North detailed how he and his wife raised their children. Simply stated, they taught by example. Their children were exposed to credible role models whose lives were characterized by their discipline and frugality. Dr. North said it best: Kids are very smart. They will not follow rules that their parents themselves do not follow. We [my wife and I] were well disciplined parents.... We lived the rules... we taught by example.... They [the children] learned by example. There must be congruency between what parents tell their children to do and what we as parents do. Kids are very perceptive in pointing out inconsistencies. Dr. North received a birthday gift from one of his daughters when she was twelve. It was a poster titled \"The King's Rules.\" On it, his daughter wrote down the rules that her father preached to his children. Dr. North still keeps this poster in his office, prominently displayed behind his desk. Kids are looking for discipline and rules. She honored me with the poster. Kids must be trained to take responsibility for their actions. Today all my children are well disciplined and frugal. They adhered to the rules. Why? Because their parents did.... Actions speak louder than rules that are just words, not actions.\n\n3. Assure that your children won't realize you're affluent until alter they have established a mature, disciplined, and adult lifestyle and profession.\n\nOnce again, Dr. North said it best: I have set up trusts for my children . . . some estate tax advantages. But my plan will not distribute money to my children until they are forty years of age or older. Because in this way my money will have little effect on their way of life at that age. They will have already adopted their own lifestyle. Dr. North also told us that he never gives his children cash gifts, not even now that they are adults. Cash gives them too many options,... especially in the case of young children. Media, especially T~ controls the values of our young. Just like they try to control what we think is funny with canned laughter.... [There's] too much emphasis on consumption. . . . I have never just given cash for this reason. What I have always told my children [is] if you need to make a major purchase, you first must fund a good bit of it yourself.\n\n4. Minimize discussions of the items that each child and grandchild will inherit or receive as gifts\n\nNever make light of verbal promises: \"Billy, you will get the house; Bob, the summer cottage; Barbara, the silver,\" especially in a group setting, especially when consuming alcohol. You may too easily forget or confuse who gets what, but the kids are not likely to forget. They will hold you and their siblings responsible for being shorted. False promises often lead to discord and conflicts.\n\n5. Never give cash or other significant gifts to your adult children as part of a negotiation strategy.\n\nGive because of love, even obligation and kindness. Adult children often lose their respect and love for parents who submit to high-pressure negotiating tactics. Coercion of this type is often the product of the manner in which parents negotiate with their young children. Even preteens are taught the benefits of \"Johnny got a bike so I should get a wagon.\" Johnny and his brother should receive symbols of love and kindness but, instead, they learn that Mom and Dad must be pushed, squeezed, and coerced into giving. The boys may begin to view each other as adversaries. Often parents perpetuate conflicts even among their adult children. Have you ever told one of your children or grandchildren something like the following: We helped your brother remodel his house/sent his kids to private school/paid his health insurance. We want you to have a few extra dollars. Would $5,000 be all right? What's wrong with such offers? Often those on the receiving end view them as signs of guilt or appeasement on the part of their parents.\n\n6. Stay out of your adult children's family matters.\n\nPlease note, parents, that your vision of the ideal lifestyle may be diametrically opposed to that of your adult son or daughter, as well as that of your son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Adult children resent interference from their parents. Let them run their own lives; ask permission even to give advice. Ask permission also when contemplating giving significant gifts to your children.\n\n7. Don't try to compete with your children.\n\nNever boast about how much money you have accumulated. This sends a confusing message. Often children can't compete with their parents on this basis, and do not really want to. You don't have to boast of your achievements. Your children are wise enough to appreciate what you have accomplished. Never start a conversation with \"When I was your age, I already had...\" To many successful, achievement-oriented children of the affluent, accumulating money is not the superordinate goal. Instead, they want to be well educated, to be respected by their peers, and to occupy a high-status position. For many of these sons and daughters, the variations in income and wealth among occupations are much less important than they are for their parents. The typical first-generation affluent American is a business owner. He has a high net worth but often low self-esteem. The low-status, high-net worth parent often lives  vicariously through his well-educated adult children who occupy high status professions. Ask a self-made millionaire a simple question: \"Mr. Ross, tell me about yourself.\" A prototypical multimillionaire (a high school dropout) recently answered this way: I was just a kid, a teenager, when we got married... never finished high school. But I started a business.... Today I'm very successful, got dozens of college graduates, my managers, working for me. By the way, did I mention that my daughter will graduate with honors from Barnard College? This same millionaire never wanted any of his children to be entrepreneurs. And, in reality, most of the children of the affluent never do become business owners. Money is second or third on their list of goals and achievements.\n\n8. Always remember that your children are individuals.\n\nThey differ from each other in motivation and achievement. Try as you may via economic outpatient care, inequalities will exist. Will economic outpatient care reduce these differences? It's unlikely. Subsidizing underachievers tends to enhance differences in wealth, not reduce them. This, in turn, can cause discord, since high-achieving brothers and sisters may resent such gift giving.\n\n9. Emphasize your children's achievements, no matter how small, not their or your symbols of success.\n\nTeach your children to achieve, not just to consume. Earning to enhance spending should not be one's ultimate goal. This is what Ken's father always taught him. Majoring in finance and marketing, Ken received an MBA with distinction. His father was a physician and a full-fledged member of the PAW group. He often told Ken: I am not impressed with what people own. But I'm impressed with what they achieve. I'm proud to be a physician. Always strive to be the best in your field.... Don't chase money. If you are the best in your field, money will find you.Ken's father lived by these beliefs. He lived well below his means and invested wisely. As Ken tells it: My dad bought a new Buick every eight years. He lived in the same house for thirty-two years. Simple house, nice house, less than an acre. Four bedrooms for six people, two bathrooms... one for Mom and Dad and the other shared by four children. What was it that Ken's father admired most about his son? First, that I worked part time as a busboy in a pancake restaurant throughout my high school years. Second, that I never asked him for money. He volunteered to lend me a few thousand dollars to start a business-right out of undergraduate school. Third, I sold the business with enough profits to fund my graduate school education completely . .. and never had to ask for a subsidy. Ken's focus today is on achievement. He is a key executive with a major communications and entertainment corporation. He is also an astute investor in both commercial real estate and quality public corporations. Also like his father, Ken is a prodigious accumulator of wealth. He lives in a modest home and drives used cars. His dad was a great role model and mentor to his son. But Ken also believes that his early experience as a busboy had a big influence on him: I got to see the masses... how the other people lived. I saw how hard people had to work to support their families . . . long, long hours at minimum wage just to get by. Money should not be wasted... no matter how much I earn.\n\n10. Tell your children that there are a lot of things more valuable than money.\n\nGood health, longevity, happiness, a loving family, selfreliance, fine friends . .. if you [have] five, you're a rich man. . . . Reputation, respect, integrity, honesty, and a history of achievements!  Money [is] icing on the cake of life.... You don't ever have to cheat or steal . .. don't have to break the law . .. [or] cheat on your taxes. It's easier to make money honestly than [dishonestly] in this country. You will never exist in business if you rip people off! Life is the long run. You can't hide from adversity. You can't hide your children from life: Ups ups and downs. The ones who achieve do so by experiencing and conquering obstacles, . . . even from their childhood days. These are the ones who were never denied their right to face some struggle, some adversity. Others were, in reality, cheated. Those who attempted to shelter their children from every conceivable germ in our society . .. never really inoculated them from fear, worry, and the feeling of dependency. Not at all.\"",

Great offense in economic terms means that a household generates an income significantly higher than the norm, which in America is an annual realized income of approximately $33,000. Most of these households also play great defense; that is, they are frugal when it comes to spending for consumer goods and services.

They try to convince other people of the validity of that logic without first taking ethos and pathos into consideration.\n\nWhen you can present your own ideas clearly, specifically, visually, and most important, contextually—in the context of a deep understanding of other people’s paradigms and concerns—you significantly increase the credibility of your ideas.\n\nYou’re not wrapped up in your “own thing,” delivering grandiose rhetoric from a soapbox. You really understand. What you’re presenting may even be different from what you had originally thought because in your effort to understand, you learned.\n\nSeeking to understand then to be understood lifts you to greater accuracy, greater integrity, in your presentations.

Win/Win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person’s success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Win/Win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It’s not your way or my way; it’s a better way, a higher way.\"",

That’s why you have such a temper. Your grandparents had short tempers and it’s in your DNA. It just goes through the generations and you inherited it. In addition, you’re Irish, and that’s the nature of Irish people.\n\nPsychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood experience essentially laid out your personal tendencies and your character structure. That’s why you’re afraid to be in front of a group. It’s the way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly guilty if you make a mistake because you “remember” deep inside the emotional scripting when you were very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You “remember” the emotional punishment, the rejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn’t perform as well as expected.\n\nEnvironmental determinism basically says your boss is doing it to you—or your spouse, or that bratty teenager, or your economic situation, or national policies. Someone or something in your environment is responsible for your situation.\n\nEach of these maps is based on the stimulus/response theory we most often think of in connection with Pavlov’s experiments with dogs. The basic idea is that we are conditioned to respond in a particular way to a particular stimulus. How accurately and functionally do these deterministic maps describe the territory? How clearly do these mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do they become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based on principles we can validate within ourselves?\n\nIn answer to those questions, let me share with you the catalytic story of Victor Frankl.

Suppose you wanted to arrive at a specific location in central Chicago. A street map of the city would be a great help to you in reaching your destination. But suppose you were given the wrong map. Through a printing error, the map labeled “Chicago” was actually a map of Detroit. Can you imagine the frustration, the ineffectiveness of trying to reach your destination? You might work on your behavior—you could try harder, be more diligent, double your speed. But your efforts would only succeed in getting you to the wrong place faster. You might work on your attitude—you could think more positively. You still wouldn’t get to the right place, but perhaps you wouldn’t care. Your attitude would be so positive, you’d be happy wherever you were. The point is, you’d still be lost. The fundamental problem has nothing to do with your behavior or your attitude. It has everything to do with having a wrong map. If you have the right map of Chicago, then diligence becomes important, and when you encounter frustrating obstacles along the way, then attitude can make a real difference. But the first and most important requirement is the accuracy of the map. Each of us has many, many maps in our head, which can be divided into two main categories: maps of the way things are, or realities, and maps of the way things should be, or values. We interpret everything we experience through these mental maps. We seldom question their accuracy; we’re usually even unaware that we have them. We simply assume that the way we see things is the way they really are or the way they should be. And our attitudes and behaviors grow out of those assumptions. The way we see things is the source of the way we think and the way we act.\"",

The real beginning of influence comes as others sense you are being influenced by them—when they feel understood by you—that you have listened deeply and sincerely, and that you are open. But most people are too vulnerable emotionally to listen deeply—to suspend their agenda long enough to focus on understanding before they communicate their own ideas.

Every day he tells you what he thinks your interest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to sell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of value appears plausible and justified by business developments and prospects. Often, on the other hand, Mr.Market lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the value he proposes seems little short of silly. “If you are a prudent investor will you let Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view as the value of your $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree with him or in case you want to trade with him. Most of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the value of your holdings.

        "title": "\"Twelve Tips for Healthy Sleep",
        "body": "1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. As\n\ncreatures of habit, people have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns. Sleeping later on weekends won’t fully make up for a lack of sleep during the week and will make it harder to wake up early on Monday morning. Set an alarm for bedtime. Often we set an alarm for when it’s time to wake up but fail to do so for when it’s time to go to sleep. If there is only one piece of advice you remember and take from these twelve tips, this should be it.\n\n2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime.\n\n3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Coffee, colas, certain teas, and chocolate contain the stimulant caffeine, and its effects can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully. Therefore, a cup of coffee in the late afternoon can make it hard for you to fall asleep at night. Nicotine is also a stimulant, often causing smokers to sleep only very lightly. In addition, smokers often wake up too early in the morning because of nicotine withdrawal.\n\n4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. Having a nightcap or alcoholic beverage before sleep may help you relax, but heavy use robs you of REM sleep, keeping you in the lighter stages of sleep. Heavy alcohol ingestion also may contribute to impairment in breathing at night. You also tend to wake up in the middle of the night when the effects of the alcohol have worn off.\n\n5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. A light snack is okay, but a large meal can cause indigestion, which interferes with sleep. Drinking too many fluids at night can cause frequent awakenings to urinate.\n\n6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep. Some commonly prescribed heart, blood pressure, or asthma medications, as well as some overthe-counter and herbal remedies for coughs, colds, or allergies, can disrupt sleep patterns. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your health care provider or pharmacist to see whether any drugs you’re taking might be contributing to your insomnia and ask whether they can be taken at other times during the day or early in the evening.\n\n7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. Naps can help make up for lost sleep, but late afternoon naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night.\n\n8. Relax before bed. Don’t overschedule your day so that no time is left for unwinding. A relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual.\n\n9. Take a hot bath before bed. The drop in body temperature after getting out of the bath may help you feel sleepy, and the bath can help you relax and slow down so you’re more ready to sleep.\n\n10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom. Get rid of anything in your bedroom that might distract you from sleep, such as noises, bright lights, an uncomfortable bed, or warm temperatures. You sleep better if the temperature in the room is kept on the cool side. A TV, cell phone, or computer in the bedroom can be a distraction and deprive you of needed sleep. Having a comfortable mattress and pillow can help promote a good night’s sleep. Individuals who have insomnia often watch the clock. Turn the clock’s face out of view so you don’t worry about the time while trying to fall asleep.\n\n11. Have the right sunlight exposure. Daylight is key to regulating daily sleep patterns. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least thirty minutes each day. If possible, wake up with the sun or use very bright lights in the morning. Sleep experts recommend that, if you have problems falling asleep, you should get an hour of exposure to morning sunlight and turn down the lights before bedtime.\n\n12. Don’t lie in bed awake. If you find yourself still awake after staying in bed for more than twenty minutes or if you are starting to feel anxious or worried, get up and do some relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. The anxiety of not being able to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep.\"",

Four other vices are personal failings that are within an individual’s capacity to prevent: krodha (hatred), mada (vanity), matsarya (envy) and moha (delusion arising from ignorance or infatuation). These six obstacles are prevented and overcome through the practice of seven essential virtues laid down from the time of Adi Shankara: ahimsa (non-violence), satyam (truth), shivam (piety), sundaram (the cultivation of beauty), vairagyam (detachment), pavitram (purity) and swabhavam (self-control).

        "body": "Of course, that specific temperature will vary depending on the individual in question and their unique physiology, gender, and age. But like calorie recommendations, it’s a good target for the average human being. Most of us set ambient house and/or bedroom temperatures higher than are optimal for good sleep and this likely contributes to lower quantity and/or quality of sleep than you are otherwise capable of getting. Lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit (12.5°C) can be harmful rather than helpful to sleep, unless warm bedding or nightclothes are used. However, most of us fall into the opposite category of setting a controlled bedroom temperature that is too high: 70 or 72 degrees. Sleep clinicians treating insomnia patients will often ask about room temperature, and will advise patients to drop their current thermostat set-point by 3 to 5 degrees from that which they currently use.\"",

        "title": "\"Little Lessons from the Four Laws",
        "body": "Cue, craving, response, reward. This framework not only teaches us how to create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights about human behavior.\n\nProblem phase\n1. Cue\n2. Craving\nSolution phase\n3. Response\n4. Reward\n\nI have compiled some lessons that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing human behavior.\n\n**Awareness comes before desire. **A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.\n\n**Happiness is simply the absence of desire**. When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state. However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.\n\n**It is the idea of pleasure that we chase.** We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.\n\n**Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.** The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace. Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing.\n\n**With a big enough why you can overcome any how**. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.\n\n**Being curious is better than being smart.** Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”\n\n**Emotions drive behavior. **Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.\n\n**We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. **The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.” Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.\n\n**Your response tends to follow your emotions.** Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two people can notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run those facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making. Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the one that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.\n\n**Suffering drives progress. **The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.\n\n**Your actions reveal how badly you want something.** If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.\n\n**Reward is on the other side of sacrifice. **Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner’s high” only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.\n\n**Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying. **A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.\n\n**Our expectations determine our satisfaction. **The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied.\n\nSatisfaction = Liking – Wanting\n\nThis is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution. Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didn’t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.\n\n**The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.** When desire is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first place. This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”\n\n**Feelings come both before and after the behavior.** Before acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, there is a feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.\n\nCue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)\nHow we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel.\n\n**Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.** Wanting and liking are the two drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.\n\n**Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. **The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on promise. The second time around, your expectation is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your hope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the likely outcome. This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.” Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only hopes.” There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning, hope is all you have\"",

Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.\n- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.\n- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\"",

        "title": "\"Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.",
        "body": "A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.\n\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\n\nGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.\n\nEvery Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants\n\nto get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.\n\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\n\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\n\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\n\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I gained twenty pounds of muscle or after my business was featured in the New York Times, then I could finally relax. Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve\n\nyour goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. It is unlikely that your actual path through life will match the exact journey you had in mind when you set out. It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\n\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\n\nFinally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.\"",

Still, nothing has happened. Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.\n\nBreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. CancerCancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.\n\nSimilarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.\n\nIf you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad\n\none, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees.

The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas.\n\nKnowledge compounds. Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative. Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. As Warren Buffett says, “That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest.”\n\nRelationships compound. People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time.\n\nNegative Compounding\n\nStress compounds. The frustration of a traffic jam. The weight of parenting responsibilities. The worry of making ends meet. The strain of slightly high blood pressure. By themselves, these common causes of stress are manageable. But when they persist for years, little stresses compound into serious health issues.\n\nNegative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.\n\nOutrage compounds.

I know practically nothing about their life. I am going to observe and wait for real data to show up. Waiting means that you allow yourself time to calm down from your initial excitement. I am not going to judge them based on rumours about them, nor buy into the hype around them.\n\nReal data is any pattern of behaviour and thought that backs a person’s actions, not words.  Choices, specifically, reveal the thought process of that person because, in making any choice, a person is also rejecting the other available options. Real data is found in the choices they make, not what they say they would like to make.\n\n2. First impressions are horseshit. Make a conscious effort to dissolve the first impressions your brain is making of people. First impressions don’t come from data, but from how you perceive the world. Two things you need to consider:\n\n- Whoever you are, or however you try to appear in front of people, manipulates your perception of people as well. For example, I am nice, therefore others must be nice as well.\n- Whatever you believe in does not change the practical reality that people are not you. If you are nice—good for you—that is by no means a guarantee that people will not be themselves.\n\nThe point is, do not rely on your intelligence to make assumptions about people if it isn’t considering the practical reality outside of you. Once you remove those general assumptions that your mind takes for granted, and the first impressions, what you are left with is, I don’t know—which is the most intellectual place to be in regarding all matters of life\n\n3. People are fucking weird. With people are weird in general as your foundational principle, you avoid falling for the assumptions your mind takes for granted, as well as first impressions. You stop seeing them as impressive, perfect, special beings. They are not. Nobody is. Instead, your outlook is slight uncertainty. You invite caution in your life and a healthy level of scepticism. You keep your trust in the back-pocket, but at the same time you aren’t judgemental, negative or dismissive of people. Like we said before, I am not going to judge them based on rumours, nor am I going to buy into the hype around them. I simply don’t know.\n\n4. We live in a world of marketing, advertising and sales. Anybody can sell you anything—having no real data creates that opportunity. The first impression is bullshit because it comes from a lack of data. Why not entertain the possibility that it is salesmanship until proven otherwise! Therefore, until you have real data, the perception ‘they are weird’, which essentially means, I don’t know them at all, helps you avoid falling into traps that take years of your life away and teach you nothing new. The next time you meet someone who forms a great first impression in your eyes, never forget, people are fucking weird. So screw the first impression no matter what they do professionally. Accept that we live in a world of marketing, so screw what they are selling—charm, looks, profundity, it doesn’t matter. And always keep an eye out for real data. That is what will end the practice of you thinking that any person who makes you feel good in the beginning is special.\"",

        "body": "mission : A mission is another important trait to acquire with your career capital when creating work you love. It provides a unifying goal for your career. It’s more general than a specific job and can span multiple positions. It provides an answer to the question “What should I do with my life?”\n\nthe adjacent possible : A term taken from the science writer Steven Johnson, who took it from Stuart Kauffman, that helps explain the origin of innovation. Johnson notes that the next big ideas in any field are typically found right beyond the current cutting edge, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combinations of existing ideas. The key observation is that you have to get to the cutting edge of a field before its adjacent possible—and the innovations it contains—becomes visible. In the context of career construction, it’s important to note that good career missions are also often found in the adjacent possible. The implication, therefore, is that if you want to find a mission in your career, you first need to get to the cutting edge of your field.\n\nlittle bets : An idea borrowed from the business writer Peter Sims. When Sims studied innovative corporations and people, he noted the following: “Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from lots of little failures and from small but significant wins” [emphasis mine]. In the context of career construction, little bets provide a good strategy for exploring productive ways to turn a vague mission idea into specific successful projects.\n\nthe law of remarkability : A simple law that can help you identify successful projects for making your mission a reality. (This can be used in conjunction with the little-bets strategy.) The law says that for a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be “remarkable” in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.\"",

        "body": "“Be so good they can’t ignore you.” : A quote from comedian Steve Martin that captures what is needed to build a working life you love. It is excerpted from the following longer quote, which Martin gave in a 2007 interview with Charlie Rose when asked what his advice was for aspiring entertainers: “Nobody ever takes note of [my advice], because it’s not the answer they wanted to hear. What they want to hear is ‘Here’s how you get an agent, here’s how you write a script,’… but I always say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore you.’ ”\n\nthe craftsman mindset : An approach to your working life in which you focus on the value of what you are offering to the world.\n\nthe passion mindset : An approach to your working life in which you focus on the value your job is offering you. This mindset stands in contrast to the craftsman mindset. The passion mindset ultimately leads to chronic dissatisfaction and daydreaming about the better jobs you imagine existing out there waiting to be discovered.\n\ncareer capital : A description of the skills you have that are rare and valuable to the working world. This is the key currency for creating work you love.\n\nthe career capital theory of great work : This theory provides the foundation for all of the ideas that follow it in this book. It claims that the key to work you love is not to follow your passion, but instead to get good at something rare and valuable, and then cash in the “career capital” this generates to acquire the traits that define great jobs. This requires that you approach work with a craftsman mindset (focusing on your value to the world) and not a passion mindset (focusing on what value the world is offering you). Here is the formal three-part definition of the theory :\n\n- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.\n- Supply and demand says that if you want these traits, you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.\n- The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on being “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to have work you love.\n\nthe 10,000-hour rule : A rule, well-known to performance scientists, describing the amount of practice time required to master a skill. Malcolm Gladwell, who popularized the concept in his 2008 book Outliers, described it as follows: “The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in studies of expertise. In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours.”\n\ndeliberate practice : The style of difficult practice required to continue to improve at a task. Florida State University professor Anders Ericsson, who coined the term in the early 1990s, describes it formally as an “activity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.” Deliberate practice requires you to stretch past where you are comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance. In the context of career construction, most knowledge workers avoid this style of skill development because, quite frankly, it’s uncomfortable. To build up large stores of career capital, however, which is necessary for creating work you love, you must make this style of practice a regular part of your work routine.\n\ncareer capital markets : When acquiring career capital in a field, you can envision that you’re acquiring this capital in a specific type of career capital market. There are two types of these markets: winner-take-all and auction. In a winner-take-all market, there is only one type of career capital available and lots of different people competing for it. An auction market, by contrast, is less structured: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate their own unique collection of this capital. Different markets require different career capital acquisition strategies. In a winner-take-all market, for example, you need to first “crack the code” on how people master the one skill that matters. In an auction market, by contrast, you might simply emphasize rareness in the skill combinations that you create.\"",

The classical literature in psychology describes the relationship between anxiety and performance, including mental performance, in terms of an upside-down U. At the peak of the inverted U is the optimal relationship between anxiety and performance, with a modicum of nerves propelling outstanding achievement. But too little anxiety—the first side of the U—brings about apathy or too little motivation to try hard enough to do well, while too much anxiety—the other side of the U—sabotages any attempt to do well. A mildly elated state—hypomania , as it is technically called—seems optimal for writers and others in creative callings that demand fluidity and imaginative diversity of thought; it is somewhere toward the peak of that inverted U. But let that euphoria get out of control to become outright mania, as in the mood swings of manic-depressives, and the agitation undermines the ability to think cohesively enough to write well, even though ideas flow freely—indeed, much too freely to pursue any one of them far enough to produce a finished product.\"",

And that doggedness depends on emotional traits—enthusiasm and persistence in the face of setbacks—above all else. The added payoff for life success from motivation, apart from other innate abilities, can be seen in the remarkable performance of Asian students in American schools and professions. One thorough review of the evidence suggests that Asian-American children may have an average IQ advantage over whites of just two or three points. Yet on the basis of the professions, such as law and medicine, that many Asian-Americans end up in, as a group they behave as though their IQ were much higher—the equivalent of an IQ of 110 for Japanese-Americans and of 120 for Chinese Americans. 6The reason seems to be that from the earliest years of school, Asian children work harder than whites. A Stanford sociologist who studied more than ten thousand high-school students, found that Asian-Americans spent 40 percent more time doing homework than did other students. “While most American parents are willing to accept a child’s weak areas and emphasize the strengths, for Asians, the attitude is that if you’re not doing well, the answer is to study later at night, and if you still don’t do well, to get up and study earlier in the morning. They believe that anyone can do well in school with the right effort.” In short, a strong cultural work ethic translates into higher motivation, zeal, and persistence— an emotion edge.\"",

Each generation has a fresh duty to revolt against these, and this will be the case forever. Moreover, for Camus, true rebellion does not mean reaching towards an ecstatic vision of a shining city on a hill. It means setting a limit on some very real present state of affairs that has become unacceptable. For example, a slave who has been ordered around all his life suddenly decides he will take no more, and draws a line, saying ‘so far but no further’. Rebellion is a reining in of tyranny.

There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.\"",

Elisabeth’s mother, thinking Merleau-Ponty unsuitable for her daughter, had warned him to back off or else she would reveal an alleged secret about his mother that she had been unfaithful, and that at least one of her children was not her husband’s. To prevent a scandal engulfing both his mother and his sister, who was about to get married, Merleau-Ponty bowed out. Beauvoir was even more disgusted after she learned the truth.\n\nHow typical of the filthy bourgeoisie! Elisabeth’s mother had shown a classic middle-class combination of moralism, cruelty and cowardice. Moreover, Beauvoir considered that the result literally proved lethal. Elisabeth had been very upset, and in the middle of the emotional crisis she caught a serious illness, probably encephalitis. She died of it, aged just twenty-one. There was no causal connection between the two disasters, but Beauvoir always thought bourgeois hypocrisy had killed her friend.\"",

        "title": "THE 10 MAJOR CAUSES OF FAILURE IN LEADERSHIP",
        "body": " 1. INABILITY TO ORGANIZE DETAILS. Efficient leadership calls for ability to organize and to master details. No genuine leader is ever \"too busy\" to do anything which may be required of him in his capacity as leader. When a man, whether he is a leader or follower, admits that he is \"too busy\" to change his plans, or to give attention to any emergency, he admits his inefficiency. The successful leader must be the master of all details connected with his position. That means, of course, that he must acquire the habit of relegating details to capable lieutenants.\n\n2. UNWILLINGNESS TO RENDER HUMBLE SERVICE. Truly great leaders are willing, when occasion demands, to perform any sort of labor which they would ask another to perform. \"The greatest among ye shall be the servant of all\" is a truth which all able leaders observe and respect.\n\n3. EXPECTATION OF PAY FOR WHAT THEY \"KNOW\" INSTEAD OF WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT WHICH THEY KNOW. The world does not pay men for that which they \"know.\" It pays them for what they DO, or induce others to do.\n\n4.FEAR OF COMPETITION FROM FOLLOWERSThe leader who fears that one of his followers may take his position is practically sure to realize that fear sooner or later. The able leader trains understudies to whom he may delegate, at will, any of the details of his position. Only in this way may a leader multiply himself and prepare himself to be at many places, and give attention to many things at one time. It is an eternal truth that men receive more pay for their ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO PERFORM, than they could possibly earn by their own efforts. An efficient leader may, through his knowledge of his job and the magnetism of his personality, greatly increase the efficiency of others, and induce them to render more service and better service than they could render without his aid.\n\n5. LACK OF IMAGINATION. Without imagination, the leader is incapable of meeting emergencies, and of creating plans by which to guide his followers efficiently.\n\n6. SELFISHNESS. The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his followers, is sure to be met by resentment. The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is contented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because he knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than they will for money alone.\n\n7. INTEMPERANCE. Followers do not respect an intemperate leader. Moreover, intemperance in any of its various forms, destroys the endurance and the vitality of all who indulge in it.\n\n8. DISLOYALTY. Perhaps this should have come at the head of the list. The leader who is not loyal to his trust, and to his associates, those above him, and those below him, cannot long maintain his leadership. Disloyalty marks one as being less than the dust of the earth, and brings down on one's head the contempt he deserves. Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life.\n\n9. EMPHASIS OF THE \"AUTHORITY\" OF LEADERSHIP. The efficient leader leads by encouraging, and not by trying to instil fear in the hearts of his followers. The leader who tries to impress his followers with his \"authority\" comes within the category of leadership through FORCE. If a leader is a REAL LEADER, he will have no need to advertise that fact except by his conduct— his sympathy, understanding, fairness, and a demonstration that he knows his job.\n\n10. EMPHASIS OF TITLE. The competent leader requires no \"title\" to give him the respect of his followers. The man who makes too much over his title generally has little else to emphasize. The doors to the office of the real leader are open to all who wish to enter, and his working quarters are free from formality or ostentation.",

        "title": "THE MAJOR ATTRIBUTES OF LEADERSHIP",
        "body": "\"1. UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self- confidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a leader very long.\n\n2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the more intelligent will emulate.\n\n3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no leader can command and retain the respect of his followers.\n\n4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions, shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.\n\n5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work, and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on the rocks.\n\n6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do more than he requires of his followers.\n\n7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality.\n\n8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their problems.\n\n9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of details of the leader's position.\n\n10. WILLINGNESS TO ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY. The successful leader must be willing to assume responsibility for the mistakes and the shortcomings of his followers. If he tries to shift this responsibility, he will not remain the leader. If one of his followers makes a mistake, and shows himself incompetent, the leader must consider that it is he who failed.\n\n11. COOPERATION. The successful leader must understand, and apply the principle of cooperative effort and be able to induce his followers to do the same. Leadership calls for POWER, and power calls for COOPERATION.\"",

After realizing he was caught between moral principles—family and nation, or the obligation to care for his mother and the obligation to avenge his brother’s death—he came to Sartre for advice. The philosopher told his student that there was no correct or incorrect decision.

Thomas Jefferson once said that all men are created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the Executive branch in Washington are fond of hurling at us. There is a tendency in this year of grace, 1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to satisfy all conditions.

We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe—some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they’re born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than others—some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.\n\n        But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal—there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president.

        "title": "\"There is a powerful formula for setting and achieving goals that you can use for the rest of your life. It consists of seven simple steps.",
        "body": "Step one: Decide exactly what you want. Either decide for yourself or sit\n\ndown with your boss and discuss your goals and objectives until you are crystal clear about what is expected of you and in what order of priority. It is amazing how many people are working away, day after day, on low-value tasks because they have not had this critical discussion with their managers. One of the very worst uses of time is to do something very well that need not\n\nbe done at all. Stephen Covey says, “If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.”\n\nStep two: Write it down. Think on paper. When you write down a goal, you crystallize it and give it tangible form. You create something that you can touch and see. On the other hand, a goal or objective that is not in writing is merely a wish or a fantasy. It has no energy behind it. Unwritten goals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection, and numerous mistakes.\n\nStep three: Set a deadline on your goal; set subdeadlines if necessary. A goal\n\nor decision without a deadline has no urgency. It has no real beginning or end. Without a definite deadline accompanied by the assignment or acceptance of specific responsibilities for completion, you will naturally procrastinate and get very little done.\n\nStep four: Make a list of everything you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal. As you think of new activities, add them to your list. Keep building your list until it is complete. A list gives you a visual picture of the larger task or objective. It gives you a track to run on. It dramatically increases the likelihood that you will achieve your goal as you have defined it and on schedule.\n\nStep five: Organize the list into a plan. Organize your list by priority and sequence. List all tasks in the order they need to be done. Take a few minutes to decide what you need to do first and what you can do later. Decide what has to be done before something else and what needs to be done afterward. Even better, lay out your plan visually in the form of a series of boxes and\n\ncircles on a sheet of paper, with lines and arrows showing the relationship of each task to every other task. You’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to achieve your goal when you break it down into individual tasks. With a written goal and an organized plan of action, you will be far more productive and efficient than people who are carrying their goals around in their minds.\n\nStep six: Take action on your plan immediately. Do something. Do anything. An average plan vigorously executed is far better than a brilliant plan on which nothing is done. For you to achieve any kind of success, execution is everything.\n\nStep seven: Resolve to do something every single day that moves you toward your major goal. Build this activity into your daily schedule. You may decide to read a specific number of pages on a key subject. You may call on a specific number of prospects or customers. You may engage in a specific period of physical exercise. You may learn a certain number of new words in a foreign language. Whatever it is, you must never miss a day. Keep pushing forward. Once you start moving, keep moving. Don’t stop.\n\nThis decision, this discipline alone, can dramatically increase your speed of goal accomplishment and boost your personal productivity.\"",

More than likely this is just a conversational opener and a display of friendly intent. Lucky you, someone has graciously taken the initiative to get the ball rolling to get to know you better. Suppose you answer “Yes.” Now what? Depending on the\n\ncontext and tone of voice, this simple “yes” could actually be heard as a rude dismissive response. Consider it from their point of view: You gave the most minimal of answers. as if the person simply wanted the information (in what is obviously a social context), and you probably forced this nice person to come up with another question if, in fact, she was trying to develop a conversational relationship with you. What if you answered, “Yes, I am.” Can you feel that this is somehow a friendlier answer? It’s like taking the offered handshake with a warm responsive grip. “Yes, I am” (a friend of the groom). This implied inclusion of the person’s language takes off the hard edge of the simple monosyllable. But you can do better, and you should. You will add an informative sentence to the basic acknowledgment (Yes, I am) that allows the conversation to be developed in a new direction. For example, you might add, “We went to Washington State when we were undergrads. We were both interested in drama.” This advances the theme of the friendly intent and also introduces free information. Free information means that you have introduced new potential topics that could now be addressed. You have already exhausted the issue of whether you are or are not a friend of the groom. Yes or no questions have a way of not leading anywhere without further questioning. Your responsiveness, your willingness to offer these encouraging bits of information, will be read as a courteous and encouraging answer and is socially appropriate. \"",

        "title": "\"If you think you may be high on self-expression and a bit low on communication, here is your own seven-step program to apply in both business and social settings.",
        "body": "It starts with a genuine desire to communicate (which means “to make common”) with people.\n\n1. Take time to figure out the interest/knowledge level of your listener. If someone asked you for directions to some place, you would need to know where they are now, wouldn’t you? You need to know their general familiarity with the area to effi ciently lead them from point A to point B. You may have to play mind reader here or ask a few initial exploratory questions. Be alert to all the information you can glean from the interaction to pick the most appropriate response to create a genuine connection with this particular person.\n\n2. Choose appropriate vocabulary. When you think about all the ways that people are different from each other, it’s a wonder we can communicate at all! But more wonderful yet is our fabulously developed language that enables us to choose our words to fi t the circumstance. A summary for your neighbor is going to sound different from a report to your boss; the data dump for your colleague must differ from the social chat with the new hire. The use of highly technical language to a nontechnical person not only puzzles him but can make him feel stupid, thus creating huge and unnecessary distances between people (like you and your mother).\n\n3. References to occupation are a common feature of most introductions. Many occupations in science and technology have become so specialized that they defy easy description to the layperson. Your title or general job description may well serve as a barrier rather than a bridge to other people outside your industry (“I’m a computer architect”). You need to construct that bridge by searching for images and experiences that your listener has had that might help you describe your work. Even if your work is nontechnical (“I’m a lab assistant”), some fl eshing out with actual descriptive language helps your listener know you better (“I make sure that the blood and urine samples are properly labeled, entered into the log, and delivered to the lab for analysis, among other things”). Let me give you an example from my work as a personal communication coach. If asked about my work, I would gauge my answer for the person asking, like this: To a stay-at-home individual: “You know how a lot of people can’t stand their voice on a recording?” (She nods.) “Well I’m the person that helps them improve the sound of their voice.” To a seven-year-old boy: “Are there boys and girls in your class that don’t talk as well as other kids?” (He nods.) “Well, I’m the kind of teacher that helps them talk really well.\"To a corporate executive: “I coach corporate executives how to be concise and powerful in their communications.”\n\nNotice that I’m telling them what I do, not\nwho I am.\n\n4. If you know you’re going to be presenting information, think fi rst so it can be organized in a manner conducive to easy comprehension , and avoid subjecting other people to your awkward on-the-spot formulations. People do not like to sit through your hemming and hawing, sentence revisions, and repetitions. Don’t take them into the kitchen when they just want the cake.\n\n5. Make it safe for people to ask for clarifi cation. Many people nod and smile and just hope to get to the end of the conversation without revealing that they are totally in the dark. There is the possibility of a serious misunderstanding with real consequences when the listener is too embarrassed to admit that he is snowed. Ethnic and cultural differences (including disinclination to admitting a lack of understanding) can also add additional danger to the assumption of a shared vocabulary.\n\n6. Get to the point immediately when speaking with decision makers. If they want data or detail, they’ll ask for it. They’ll have only so much attention for you so you must think of economy of presentation. If you can respect their time, they’re likely to respect your mind.\n\n7. Select your small talk thoughtfully in social conversation. Chatting is the time for short pleasantries with speaking opportunities passing back and forth, much like the volley in a tennis game. Don’t embark on detailed information, any story over 5 minutes in length, or anything intricate. These require a follow-up meeting to allow more focused attention. Social situations are for people interaction, not long monologues.\n\nIf you are willing to invest 50 percent of your\n\nattention in your listener/audience, you’ll get a 100 percent reception from them.\"",

Reach your right arm low behind your back and try to touch or hold the fi ngers of your left hand. If you can’t reach, you can hold a handkerchief in your left hand for your right hand to reach for. Hold until it becomes uncomfortable, and then switch arms and repeat the exercise. Your shoulders should feel warm and loose.\n\nTo maximize air intake without shoulder tension: After you’ve loosened your shoulders, you should feel a relaxation in the upper back and chest. Keeping that relaxed feeling, let your arms hang heavy from the shoulders. Take a deep breath of air into your belly, not into your upper chest. Imagine the air fi lling up your lower back. You are breathing down, not up. This will be contrary to all the images of “taking a nice deep breath” to which you have been exposed, where people heave their shoulders up and make a big deal of inhalation. Relaxed inhalation is quiet and rather invisible, unless you are looking at the midsection of the body.\n\nTo support breathing-friendly posture:\n\nStand with both arms straight up in the air, hands bent back and fl at as if you were pushing up on the ceiling. Put great effort into inducing tension into your arms and shoulders as you push up. Hold as long as you can, and then let go. Let your arms hang and relax; they should feel warm and light. Keep your chest up exactly where it was in the exercise, elevated and ready for effi cient breathing.

But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.’\n    - Example with “and”: ‘We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.’\n- “Calling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism.”\n\n**Principle 3: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.**\n\n- “It isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.”\n\n**Principle 4: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.**\n\n- Asking questions gives others a chance to figure out how to do things themselves and gives them ownership and a sense of importance over the task.\n- “Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.”\n\n**Principle 5: Let the other person save face.**\n\n- “We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person’s pride. Whereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting!”\n- “Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face.”\n- Antoine de Saint-Exupery: I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.\n\n**Principle 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.’**\n\n- “You who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire them with a realization of their latent possibilities.”\n- “Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.”\n- Be specific in your praise: “Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.”\n\n**Principle 7: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.**\n\n- “If you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.”\n\n**Principle 8: Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.**\n\n- Emphasize the positive and be careful not to discourage through too much focus on mistakes and errors.\n- The goal is to foster a desire to improve rather than foster a desire to quit.\n- “Be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it – and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.”\n\n**Principle 9: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.**\n\n- Making the person feel important is key.\n- When asking someone to perform a task that might seem undesirable, be sure to consider and articulate the benefits that align with the person’s wants.\n- “It is naïve to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these approaches, but the experience of most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this way than by not using these principles – and if you increase your successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10 percent more effective as a leader than you were before – and that is your benefit.” \"",

        "body": "**Principle 1: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.**\n\n- “Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn’t ask for your opinion. He didn’t want it. Why argue with him?”\n- “I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument – and that is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.”\n- “Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right.”\n- “You can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it.”\n- “Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person’s good will? You can seldom have both.”\n- “A misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.”\n- Suggestions for keeping a disagreement from escalating:\n    - Welcome the disagreement.\n    - Distrust your first instinctive impression.\n    - Control your temper.\n    - Listen first.\n    - Look for areas of agreement.\n    - Be honest.\n    - Promise to think over your opponent’s ideas.\n    - Thank your opponents for their interest.\n    - Postpone action to think through the problem.\n\n**Principle 2: Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re wrong.’**\n\n- “If you can’t be sure of being right even 55% of the time, why should you tell other people they are wrong?”\n- Telling people they are wrong strikes a direct blow at their “intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect.”\n- Galileo: You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him find it within himself.\n- Phrases like “I might be wrong, but let’s examine the facts” is one way to diplomatically approach wrong ideas.\n- “When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our oesophagus.”\n- Benjamin Franklin: ‘I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiment of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix’d opinion, such as “certainly,” “undoubtedly,” etc., and I adopted, instead of them, “I conceive,” “I apprehend,” or “I imagine” a thing to be so or so, or “it so appears to me at present.”\n\n**Principle 3: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.**\n\n- “If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn’t it much easier to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?”\n- “There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one’s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the error.”\n- “When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong – and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves – let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.”\n- Proverb: By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\n\n**Principle 4: Begin in a friendly way.**\n\n- Lincoln: “It is an old and true maxim that ‘a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.’ So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.”\n- Friendliness begets friendliness.\n\n**Principle 5: Get the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately.**\n\n- Emphasize the things with which you agree and defer considering the areas in which you differ.\n- Emphasize that both parties want the same goal and that any difference is one of methodology rather than purpose.\n- “A ‘No’ response…is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said ‘No,’ all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the ‘No’ was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it.”\n- Look to the Socratic method: “His whole technique…was based upon getting a ‘yes, yes’ response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree…until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.”\n\n**Principle 6: Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.**\n\n- “Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves.”\n- La Rouchefoucauld: If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.\n- Talk less and listen more.\n\n**Principle 7: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.**\n\n- “No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.”\n- For businesses one important lesson is to get feedback from your customers on how best to solve their problem.\n- Results are more important than getting credit for an idea.\n- Lao-Tze: ‘The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, puts himself below them; wishing to be before them, he puts himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.’\n\n**Principle 8: Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.**\n\n- “There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason – and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.”\n- Gerald Nirenberg: “Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.”\n\n**Principle 9: Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.**\n\n- Dale Carnegie’s “magic phrase” for stopping arguments and creating good will: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.”\n- “Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.”\n\n**Principle 10: Appeal to the nobler motives.**\n\n- “All people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.”\n- “A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.”\n- One strategy for changing or influencing others is to appeal to their nobler motives. Make an appeal to the person’s sense of honesty, fairness, integrity and sincerity.\n\n**Principle 11: Dramatize your ideas.**\n\n- “Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic.”\n- This idea is necessary in order to earn attention and stand above your peers and competitors.\n\n**Principle 12: Throw down a challenge.**\n\n- Charles Schwab: “The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”\n- Interesting, stimulating and exciting work is, in itself, a kind of motivation for people: it makes them look forward to the challenge.\n- The desire to excel instills a feeling of importance in people and feeling important is one of the greatest universal desires.\"",

        "title": "\"Six Ways to Make People Like You",
        "body": "**Principle 1: Become genuinely interested in other people.**\n\n- “People are not interested in you…they are interested in themselves—morning, noon and after dinner.”\n- Alfred Adler: “It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.”\n- “One can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them.”\n- “If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people—things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.”\n- Greet people with animation and enthusiasm.\n- “A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention.”\n\n**Principle 2: Smile.**\n\n- The expression on your face is more important than the clothes you wear on your back.\n- A smile communicates: “I like you, You make me happy. I am glad to see you.”\n- “You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.”\n- Shakespeare: “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”\n- “Your smile is a messenger of good will.”\n\n**Principle 3: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.**\n\n- “The average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together.”\n- Remembering a person’s name and using it in conversation is a powerful but subtle compliment.\n- “Most people don’t remember names, for the simple reason that they don’t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are too busy.”\n\nTechnique for remembering names:\n\n    - If you do not hear the name clearly, ask for it to be repeated.\n    - If the name is particularly challenging, ask for it to be spelled.\n    - Repeat the name several times during a conversation.\n- “The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others.”\n\n**Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.**\n\n- “Very important people have told me that they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen seems rarer than almost any other good trait.”\n- “If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is talking, don’t wait for him or her to finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.”\n- “People who talk only of themselves think only of themselves.”\n- In order to be a good conversationalist, you must be an attentive listener.\n- “The people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.”\n\n**Principle 5: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.**\n\n- Guest of Theodore Roosevelt were astonished at his range of knowledge. But he had a secret trick he used: “Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested. For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.”\n\n**Principle 6: Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely.**\n\n- In order to say something kind about another person, observe and ask yourself: “What is there about this person that I can honestly admire?”\n- Strive to radiate happiness and “pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return…”\n- William James: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”\n\nSimple phrases that convey respect and politeness:\n\n    - “I’m sorry to trouble you…”\n    - “Would you be so kind as to…”\n    - “Would you mind?”\n- “All the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you realize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.” \"",

It is more profitable and less dangerous.\n- “When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.”\n- Carlyle: “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.”\n- Try to understand the point of view of the other person in order to foster sympathy, tolerance and kindness.\n\n**Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.**\n\n- The only way to get someone do to something is to make the person want to do it.\n- Delivering something a person wants is an effective strategy.\n- John Dewey: The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.\n\nCommon wants:\n\n    - Health and preservation of life.\n    - Food and sleep.\n    - Money and the things money buys.\n    - Life in the hereafter.\n    - Sexual gratification.\n    - Well-being for our children.\n    - A feeling of importance.\n- “We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem?”\n- Appreciation is sincere; flattery is not.\n- “Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.”\n- We spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about ourselves.\n- Expressions of appreciation should be given both to family and friends as well as to people who help, service or inform us in our daily lives.\n- “Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.”\n- Make an effort to identify and verbalize the good points in others.\n\n**Principle 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want.**\n\n- “The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.”\n- Henry Ford: “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”\n- Advice to sales people: Offer and demonstrate how your product can solve other people’s problems.\n- “The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking.

Then, it’s just mix-and-match. You pick a pair of jeans, a nice shirt, and then throw on your “brown set” or your “black set”— whichever set compliments the shirt and jeans the best. I like to wear the brown set with lighter shirts and jeans, and the black set with darker shirts and jeans. Of course, dressing gets more complicated than this, but this is an easy and fail-safe way to start out.\"",

The answer is, totally appropriately to the force and mass of the input; then it returns to calm. It doesn’t overreact or underreact. Water is what it is, and does what it does. It can overwhelm, but it’s not overwhelmed. It can be still, but it is not impatient. It can be forced to change course, but it is not frustrated. Get it? The power in a karate punch comes from speed, not muscle; it comes from a focused “pop” at the end of the whip. That’s why petite people can learn to break boards and bricks with their hands: it doesn’t take calluses or brute strength; just the ability to generate a focused thrust with speed. But a tense muscle is a slow one. So the high levels of training in the martial arts teach and demand balance and relaxation as much as anything else. Clearing the mind to being open and appropriately responsive is the key. Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does. Responding inappropriately to your e-mail, your thoughts about what you need to do, your children, or your boss will lead to less effective results than you’d like. Most people give either more or less attention to things than they deserve, simply because they don’t operate with a mind like water.\"",

        "body": "1. Stand up for Meetings\n\nConduct all short-term decision-making meetings standing up. Studies show that standing conversations are significantly shorter than sitting ones and the person who conducts a stand- ing meeting is perceived as having higher status than those who sit. Standing whenever others enter your workspace is also an excellent timesaver, so consider having no visitors' chairs in your own work area. Standing decisions are quick and to the point and others don't waste your time with social chatter or questions such as 'How's the family?'\n\n2. Sit Competitors with Their Backs to the Door\n\nStudies reveal that when our backs are towards an open space we become stressed, blood pressure increases, our heart beats faster, our brainwave output increases and we breathe more quickly as our body readies itself for a possible rear attack. This is an excellent position in which to place your opponents.\n\n3. Keep Your Fingers Together\n\nPeople who keep their fingers closed when they talk with their hands and keep their hands below chin level, command the most attention. Using open fingers or having your hands held above the chin is perceived as less powerful.\n\n4. Keep Your Elbows Out\n\nWhen you sit on a chair, keep your elbows out or on the armsof the chair. Submissive, timid individuals keep their elbows in to protect themselves and are perceived as fearful.\n\n5. Use Power Words\n\nA study at the University of California showed that the most persuasive words in spoken language are: discovery, guarantee, love, proven, results, save, easy, health, money, new,\n\nsafety and you. Practise using these words. The new results you'll get from the discovery of these proven words will guarantee you more love, better health and will save you money. And they're completely safe, and easy to use.\n\n6. Carry a Slim Briefcase\n\nA slim briefcase with a combination lock is carried by an important person who is concerned only with the bottom-line details; large, bulky briefcases are carried by those who do all the work and are perceived as not being sufficiently organised to get things done on time.\n\n7. Watch Their Coat Buttons\n\nAnalysis of videotaped confrontations, for example, between unions and corporations, show a higher frequency of agree- ment is reached when people have their coats unbuttoned. People who cross their arms on their chest often do it with their jacket buttoned and are more negative. When a person suddenly unbuttons their jacket in a meeting, you can reason- ably assume that they have also just opened their mind.\n\nBefore you go to an important interview or meeting, sit quietly for five minutes and mentally practise seeing yourself doing these things and doing them well. When your mind sees them clearly, your body will be able to carry them out and others will react accordingly.\"",

Tension is further increased if the person's back is towards an open door or a window at ground level. So this a good position to seat someone when you want to unnerve or rattle. Next, the lights should be dimmed and muffled background music should be played to relax the senses. It would be best to use a round table and to have the other person's view of other people obscured by a screen or large green plant if you want a captive audience.It is far easier to obtain a favourable decision under these circumstances than it will ever be in restaurants that have bright lighting, tables and chairs placed in open areas and the banging of plates, knives and forks.\"",

Eye contact: She looks across the room and spots a man she fancies. She waits till he notices her then holds his gaze for about five seconds and then turns away. He now keeps watching her to see if she does it again. A woman needs to deliver this gaze, on average, three times before the average man realises what's happening. This gaze process can be repeated several times and is the start of the flirting process.\n\nStage 2. Smiling: She delivers one or more fleeting smiles. This is a quick half smile that is intended to give a prospective man the green light to make an approach. Unfortunately, many men are not responsive to these signals, leaving the woman feeling that he's not interested in her.\n\nStage 3. Preening: She sits up straight to emphasise her breasts and crosses her legs or ankles to show them to best advantage or, if she's standing, she tilts her hips and tilts her head sideways towards one shoulder, exposing her bare neck. She plays with her hair for up to six seconds — suggesting she is grooming herself for her man. She may lick her lips, flick her hair and straighten her clothing and jewellery. He'll respond with gestures such as standing up straight, pulling his stomach in, expanding his chest, adjusting his clothing, touching his hair and tucking his thumbs into his belt. They both point their feet or entire bodies towards each other.\n\nStage 4. Talk: He approaches and attempts to make small talk, using cliches such as, 'Haven't I seen you somewhere before?' and other well-worn lines that are purely intended to break the ice.\n\nStage 5. Touch: She looks for an opportunity to initiate a light touch on the arm, either 'accidental' or otherwise. A hand touch indicates a higher level of intimacy than a touch on the arm. Each level of touch is then repeated to check that the person is happy with this level of intimacy and to let them know that the first touch was not accidental. Lightly brushing or touching the shoulder of a man is done to give the impression that the woman cares about his health and appearance. Shaking hands is a quick way to move to the touch stage.\n\nThese first five stages of courtship may seem minor or even incidental but they are critical to starting any new relationship and are the stages that most people, especially men, find difficult.\"",

        "body": "All studies into courtship, however, show that women are the initiators 90% of the time. A woman does this by sending a series of subtle eye, body and facial signals to the targeted man, who, assuming he is perceptive enough to pick them up, responds to them. It just looks as if he made the first move because he made the walk across the floor.\n\nMen find it difficult to interpret the more subtle cues in women's body language and research shows that men tend to mistake friendliness and smiling for sexual interest.\n\nWhen they meet a possible partner, women send out subtle, but often deceptive, courting signals to see whether he's worth pursuing. Women tend to bombard men with courting rituals in the first minutes of meeting them. Men may misinterpret these signals and make a clumsy pass. By sending erratic and ambiguous signals in the early stages, women manipulate men into showing their hand. This is one reason why many women have trouble attracting men — men become confused and won't make an approach.\"",

This is the area of the\n   face we look at in a non-threatening\n   environment. The other Person will perceive\n   you as non-aggressive.\n\n![screenshot_2020-12-02-09-05-19-90_58f827c9f8cd1dffd850cad9571f3f22.jpg](:/3ff9b2d591976ba862889b638aa0e5e8)\n\n2.The Intimate Gaze\n   When people approach each other from\n   a distance, they look quickly between the\n   other person's face and lower body to first\n   establish what the sex of the person is and\n   then a second time to determine a level of\n   interest in them. This gaze is across the\n   eyes and below the chin to lower parts of\n   the person's body. In close encounters, it's\n   the triangular area between the eyes\n   and the chest and for distant gazing it's\n   from the eyes to the groin or below. Men and\n   women use this gaze to show interest in\n   each other and those who are interested will\n   return the gaze.We usually give two quick\n   glances and then look at their face.\n\n![screenshot_2020-12-02-18-25-00-65_58f827c9f8cd1dffd850cad9571f3f22.jpg](:/78335701d2a8510a6683cbdf9d9e405a)\n\n    Looking down towards the ground during conversation serves different purposes for men and    women. For a man, it lets him give a woman the once over. For a woman, it has the dual purpose of letting her check him out and at the same time send a submissive\n\nsignal of looking away and down.\n\n3.The Power Gaze\n    Imagine the person has a third eye in the\n    centre of their forehead and look in a\n    triangular area between the person's 'three'\n    eyes. The impact this gaze has on the other\n    person has to be experienced to be\n    believed. Not only does it change the\n    atmosphere to very serious, it can stop\n    a bore dead in their tracks. By keeping your\n    gaze directed at this area, you keep the\n    screws firmly on them. Provided your gaze\n    doesn't drop below the level of their eyes,\n    the pressure will stay on them. Never use\n    this in friendly or romantic encounters. But\n    it works a treat on the person who you want\n    to intimidate or on the person who simply\n    won't shut up.\n\n![screenshot_2020-12-02-18-25-05-06_58f827c9f8cd1dffd850cad9571f3f22.jpg](:/88087f80a61b68bfbd89c52be4a08766)\n\n\"",

If you are a habitual finger-pointer, try practising the palm-up and palm-down positions and you'll find that you can create a more relaxed atmosphere and have a more positive effect on others. Alternatively, if you squeeze your fingers against your thumb to make an 'OK' type of gesture and talk using this position, you'll come across as authoritative, but not aggressive. We taught this gesture to groups of speakers, politicians and business leaders and we measured the audience reactions. The audiences who listened to the speakers who used the fingertip-touch gestures described those speakers as 'thoughtful', 'goal-oriented' and 'focused'.\n\n![screenshot_2020-11-29-08-33-18-21_58f827c9f8cd1dffd850cad9571f3f22.jpg](:/09f8e4af2d868ba9f35334f2b856d733)\n\nSpeakers who used the finger-pointed position were described as 'aggressive', 'belligerent' and 'rude' and recorded the lowest amount of information retention by their audience. When the speaker pointed directly at the audience, the delegates became preoccupied with making personal judgements about the speaker rather than listening to his content.\"",

If it’s an essay exam or a technical exam with a relatively small number of questions, then read each prompt carefully. If the exam is multiple choice or contains many questions, skim through quickly and get a feel for which topics are covered.\n\nStrategy #2: Build a Time Budget\n\nFirst, take the time allotted for the exam and subtract ten minutes. Next, divide this amount by the number of questions. The result is how long you have to spend on each prompt.\n\nStrategy #3: Proceed from Easy to Hard\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it first focuses your energy on the questions you know the most about, ensuring that you get maximum points on these. It also gives you a better chance of conquering the more difficult ones.\n\nStrategy #4: Outline Essays\n\nTo do so, use the margin of the exam to jot down all of the points you can recall that are relevant to the question. Record only a few key words for each point to save time and space.\n\nStrategy #5: Check Your Work\n\nIf, after your first round of review, you still have time left over, then go through and check again.It’s tempting to relax after finishing your exam, perhaps walking proudly to the front of the classroom and handing it in before anyone else. But aside from the wistful stares of your classmates, this strategy is ill conceived. Double checking your work up to the last minute can make the difference between an above-average student and an academic star.\"",

        "body": "1. Drink water constantly. Have a water bottle with you, or make frequent trips to the water fountain. One of my favorite study spots had a dispenser of mini–paper cups next to the fountain. My habit was to drink five mini-cups of water every forty-five minutes. It worked wonders toward keeping my mind humming and my energy high. Your body needs water to function. Hydration increases your energy, masks boredom-induced food cravings, and staves off sleepiness. And don’t worry about the inevitable side effect of so much drinking. As Greta, a straight-A Dartmouth student, exults: “Frequent bathroom trips keep me awake.”\n\n2. Monitor your caffeine intake carefully. Don’t drink more than one large caffeinated beverage in any one-hour period. While a Coke or cup of coffee can heighten your concentration, too much caffeine in a short period will make you jumpy and unfocused. If you’re a coffee drinker, start off with a strong brew to jump-start your mind, but switch to decaf, tea, or just water for the next hour or two before returning to another strong drink.\n\n3. Treat food as a source of energy, not satisfaction. When studying, carefully choose satisfaction. When studying, carefully choose snacks that promise a long-term energy boost. Try vegetables, fruit, anything whole grain, lean proteins, peanuts, or natural granola bars. Refined carbohydrates, such as sugar and white flour, will provide only a quick energy rush followed immediately by a damaging energy drain and increased appetite. Avoid these unhealthy snacks at all costs while working. If you follow rule one, your frequent water consumption will dull the cravings for specific foods, making it much easier to stick with healthier fare.\n\n4. Don’t skip meals. Snacks alone are not enough to fuel your mind for long periods. Even on the busiest of days, eat regular meals. If you skip breakfast to get a jump start on studying, or put off lunch until the late afternoon so you can finish your reading, you will experience more hunger than your snacks can effectively satisfy. Hunger, and the corresponding low blood sugar, will rob you of your ability to concentrate and set you up to succumb to procrastination. So keep your meals regular. If you’re pressed for time, eat fast. Grab a sandwich from a less-populated dining hall and sit alone, or bring part of the meal back to your study location. But never miss meals altogether.\"",

According to our formula, this same amount of work can be accomplished in only three one-hour bursts, each with an intensity of 10.

        "body": "1. Set the table: Decide exactly what you want. Clarity is essential. Write out your goals and objectives before you begin.\n\n2. Plan every day in advance: Think on paper. Every minute you spend in planning can save you five or ten minutes in execution.\n\n3. Apply the 80/20 Rule to everything: Twenty percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results. Always concentrate your efforts on that top 20 percent.\n\n4. Consider the consequences: Your most important tasks and priorities are those that can have the most serious consequences, positive or negative, on your life or work. Focus on these above all else.\n\n5. Practice creative procrastination: Since you can’t do everything, you must learn to deliberately put off those tasks that are of low value so that you have enough time to do the few things that really count.\n\n6. Use the ABCDE Method continually: Before you begin work on a list of tasks, take a few moments to organize them by value and priority so you can be sure of working on your most important activities.\n\n7. Focus on key result areas: Identify those results that you absolutely, positively have to get to do your job well, and work on them all day long.\n\n8. Apply the Law of Three: Identify the three things you do in your work that account for 90 percent of your contribution, and focus on getting them done before anything else. You will then have more time for your family and personal life.\n\n9. Prepare thoroughly before you begin: Have everything you need at hand before you start. Assemble all the papers, information, tools, work materials, and numbers you might require so that you can get started and keep going.\n\n10. Take it one oil barrel at a time: You can accomplish the biggest and most complicated job if you just complete it one step at a time.\n\n11. Upgrade your key skills: The more knowledgeable and skilled you become at your key tasks, the faster you start them and the sooner you get them done. Determine exactly what it is that you are very good at doing, or could be very good at, and throw your whole heart into doing those specific things very, very well.\n\n12. Identify your key constraints: Determine the bottlenecks or choke points, internal or external, that set the speed at which you achieve your most important goals, and focus on alleviating them.\n\n13. Put the pressure on yourself: Imagine that you have to leave town for a month, and work as if you had to get your major task completed before you left.\n\n14. Motivate yourself into action: Be your own cheerleader. Look for the good in every situation. Focus on the solution rather than the problem. Always be optimistic and constructive.\n\n15. Technology is a terrible master: Take back your time from enslaving technological addictions. Learn to often turn devices off and leave them off.\n\n16. Technology is a wonderful servant: Use your technological tools to confront yourself with what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important.\n\n17. Focus your attention: Stop the interruptions and distractions that interfere with completing your most important tasks.\n\n18. Slice and dice the task: Break large, complex tasks down into bite-sized pieces, and then do just one small part of the task to get started.\n\n19. Create large chunks of time: Organize your days around large blocks of time so you can concentrate for extended periods on your most important tasks.\n\n20. Develop a sense of urgency: Make a habit of moving fast on your key tasks. Become known as a person who does things quickly and well.\n\n21. Single handle every task: Set clear priorities, start immediately on your most important task, and then work without stopping until the job is 100 percent complete. This is the real key to high performance and maximum personal productivity.\"",

Remember, from your very first word, your tonality must be positive and upbeat, with a hint of bottled enthusiasm slipping out around the edges.\n\n2 Remind him that you two spoke a few days or a few weeks ago, and that you emailed him a bit of information on your company. Do not—I repeat, do not—ask him if he actually received the information or had a chance to review it, as there’s an excellent possibility that he’ll say “no” to at least one of those questions, which gives him an easy exit ramp out of the encounter. The way to avoid this is to simply ask him if the conversation “rings a bell,” to which he will almost always reply with a yes.\n\n3 Once he does, then briefly explain to him how the last time you spoke, he asked you to give him a call the next time an extraordinary investment idea came across your desk.\n\n4 If he replies no, then act a bit surprised, but chalk it up to the fact that he must get a ton of calls and emails each day, and then assure him that you did, in fact, speak to him, and that you did, in fact, email him some information; but there’s no need to worry, as it was just a bit of background on your company. Then complete step three—reminding him that he asked you to call him the next time you had an investment idea.\n\n5 Explain how something just came across your desk and that it’s one of the best things you’ve seen in quite some time now, and if he has sixty seconds, you’d like to share the idea with him.\n\n6 Complete your introduction by saying “Got a minute?” using the reasonable man tone.\"",

        "title": "\"Powerful tips and guidelines for creating language patterns for the body and the close.",
        "body": "1 The moment you finish the transition, your first words in the main body should be the exact name of your product, process, program, or service you’re offering. Here’s an example of this that I wrote for the\n\nmovie The Wolf of Wall Street:\n\n“Name of the company . . . Aerotyne International. It’s a cutting- edge, high-tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a next generation of radar detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications.”\n\n2 The next language pattern should be no more than one or two paragraphs and be focused on a benefit that directly fills the clients need. (Only mention that feature.) If possible, try to use comparisons and metaphors to illustrate your point, as they are far more effective than facts and figures alone. In addition, if you can ethically link the above pattern to a trustworthy person or institution, like a Warren Buffett or J. P. Morgan,then do it. (Also, check to see if your company knows of any high-profile people who have used your product and liked it.) The bottom line is that anytime you can leverage the credibility of a respected person or institution, you should try to bring it into your presentation.\n\n3 After you’re done with the pattern, you should say, “You follow me so far?” or “Make sense?” You can only move forward after the prospect says yes; otherwise you’ll break rapport and enter the death zone. But once they agree with you—boom!—you’ve completed one full language pattern.\n\n4 Now, repeat steps two and three one more time—and then one more time again, but no more than that, or you’ll run the risk of overwhelming the client. Always remember, you’re framing, not front-loading!\n\n5 As you’re transitioning into your close, you should try to create some type of urgency—meaning, why the customer needs to buy now. If you’re in an industry where there’s not a lot of inherent urgency, then try to at least use tonal scarcity to imply urgency. But don’t create false urgency; that’s not okay.\n\n6 Moving from the main body to the close, we start with a transitional pattern that explains how simple it is to get the buying process started. (This is your energy in, benefits out equation.)\n\n7 Then you directly ask for the order, with no beating around the bush. The reason I’m highlighting this is that after spending the last ten years training sales forces all around the world, I’ve found that the vast majority of salespeople don’t ask for the order very much. Either they dance around it, or they leave it open-ended, as if they’re hoping the prospect will just come right out and say they want to buy it. In point of fact, most studies peg the optimum number of times that a salesperson should ask for the order as somewhere between five and seven times. Personally, however, I strongly disagree, and I think that number has more to do with poorly trained salespeople going through the closing process in a wildly inefficient way. Three or four times should be more than enough when you’re using the Straight Line System. Remember, this is not about pressuring people into making bad decisions; this is about using the Straight Line System to create massive certainty in the mind of your prospect, on both a logical and emotional level, and then asking for the order in a low-pressure, graceful way. Here’s a typical language pattern for a close:\n\nGive me one shot, and believe me, if I’m even half-right, the only problem you’ll have is that I didn’t call you six months ago and get you started then. Sound fair enough?”",

This next pattern is extremely important and is the reason for the call, your justifier. In essence, your justifier creates a valid reason to be calling today, and it will dramatically increase your compliance rate.\n\n4. Fromhere you get into the qualifying portion of your script, and you start by asking for permission to ask questions. This is another example of using a justifier, this time with the word “so.” “Just a couple of quick questions so I don’t waste your time.” This gives a reason why you need to ask the prospect questions, and that reason is so you don’t waste their time. You always want to ask for permission to qualify.\n\n5. Thelast part of your open is always a transition. “Based on everything you said to me, this is a perfect fit for you.” This should be an anchor for you; you should know it by heart.\"",

Fourth, you want to identify their values—meaning, what things are most important to them?

It can even be that the prospect is an action junkie and they’re in it for the thrills.\n\nFifth, you want to identify their financial standards, insofar as what level of wealth and spending ability they need to have to feel good about themselves. Sixth, where their pain lies—meaning, what’s keeping them up at night? What’s that one single financial worry that sits at the very base of their skull and weighs them down, like an anchor? You see, at the end of the day, it’s knowing your prospect’s pain and, if necessary, amplifying that pain; if they’re currently in denial, that’s going to help you close the tougher sales.

        "body": "The most important lessons learnt from two decades of investing\n• Investing is fun, exciting, and dangerous if you don’t do any work.\n\n• Your investor’s edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It’s something you already have. You can outperform the experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand.\n\n• Over the past three decades, the stock market has come to be dominated by a herd of professional investors. Contrary to popular belief, this makes it easier for the amateur investor. You can beat the market by ignoring the herd.\n\n• Behind every stock is a company. Find out what it’s doing.\n\n• Often, there is no correlation between the success of a company’s operations and the success of its stock over a few months or even a few years. In the long term, there is a 100 percent correlation between the success of the company and the success of its stock. This disparity is the key to making money; it pays to be patient, and to own successful companies.\n\n• You have to know what you own, and why you own it. “This baby is a cinch to go up!” doesn’t count.\n\n• Long shots almost always miss the mark.\n\n• Owning stocks is like having children—don’t get involved with more than you can handle. The part-time stockpicker probably has time to follow 8–12 companies, and to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant. There don’t have to be more than 5 companies in the portfolio at any one time.\n\n• If you can’t find any companies that you think are attractive, put your money in the bank until you discover some.\n\n• Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets. Always look at the balance sheet to see if a company is solvent before you risk your money on it.\n\n• Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. Great companies in cold, nongrowth industries are consistent big winners.\n\n• With small companies, you’re better off to wait until they turn a profit before you invest.\n\n• If you’re thinking about investing in a troubled industry, buy the companies with staying power. Also, wait for the industry to show signs of revival. Buggy whips and radio tubes were troubled industries that never came back.\n\n• If you invest $1,000 in a stock, all you can lose is $1,000, but you stand to gain $10,000 or even $50,000 over time if you’re patient. The average person can concentrate on a few good companies, while the fund manager is forced to diversify. By owning too many stocks, you lose this advantage of concentration. It only takes a handful of big winners to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile.\n\n• In every industry and every region of the country, the observant amateur can find great growth companies long before the professionals have discovered them.\n\n• A stock-market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If you’re prepared, it can’t hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic.\n\n• Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and stock mutual funds altogether.\n\n• There is always something to worry about. Avoid weekend thinking and ignore the latest dire predictions of the newscasters. Sell a stock because the company’s fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.\n\n• Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy, or the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what’s actually happening to the companies in which you’ve invested.\n\n• If you study 10 companies, you’ll find 1 for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you’ll find 5. There are always pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market—companies whose achievements are being overlooked on Wall Street.\n\n• If you don’t study any companies, you have the same success buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards.\n\n• Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. You can afford to be patient—even if you missed Wal-Mart in the first five years, it was a great stock to own in the next five years. Time is against you when you own options.\n\n• If you have the stomach for stocks, but neither the time nor the inclination to do the homework, invest in equity mutual funds. Here, it’s a good idea to diversify. You should own a few different kinds of funds, with managers who pursue different styles of investing: growth, value, small companies, large companies, etc. Investing in six of the same kind of fund is not diversification. The capital-gains tax penalizes investors who do too much switching from one mutual fund to another. If you’ve invested in one fund or several funds that have done well, don’t abandon them capriciously. Stick with them.\n\n• Among the major stock markets of the world, the U.S. market ranks eighth in total return over the past decade. You can take advantage of the faster-growing economies by investing some portion of your assets in an overseas fund with a good record.\n\n• In the long run, a portfolio of well-chosen stocks and/or equity mutual funds will always outperform a portfolio of bonds or a money-market account. In the long run, a portfolio of poorly chosen stocks won’t outperform the money left under the mattress.\"",

        "body": "The math looks very favorable. The purchase price for Dorney is $48 million. Since Dorney earned nearly $4 million in the prior year, the p/e of the acquisition is 12. Cedar Fair is not paying all cash. It is paying $27 million in cash, financed by\n\ndebt, and the balance in a million Cedar Fair shares, to be given to the owners of Dorney Park. Here’s how I analyze the deal. Cedar Fair was earning $1.80 a share prior to\n\nthe purchase. With a million new shares on the books, it will have to come up with an extra $1.8 million in earnings to maintain the status quo. It will also have to pay $1.7 million in interest on the $27 million it borrowed to make the acquisition. Where will Cedar Fair get this $3.5 million in extra earnings plus interest payments? From Dorney Park’s estimated $4 million annual earnings. On the face of it, this deal adds to Cedar Fair’s earnings. So what happened when the Dorney Park sale was announced? Cedar Fair’s\n\nstock didn’t budge from $19 for weeks. You don’t have to be an insider to get in on this deal. You can read about it in the newspapers, take your time analyzing the situation, and still buy Cedar Fair stock at a predeal price.\"",

There, the slogan would have been “When Nomura Securities Commands, People Obey.” Brokers were entirely trusted, and their advice was taken as gospel. The Japanese bought $500,000 cats on cue. The result was a wondrous market of stocks with p/e ratios of 50, 100, 200, which were so out of line with rational levels that bystanders began to theorize that the high Japanese p/e was a cultural trait.  The Japanese market has been subject to behind-the-scenes finagling to a degree unknown on Wall Street since the 1920s. Large investors in Japan had a money-back guarantee from the brokerage firms—when they lost money, the brokers paid them back.  At a later interview with one of the best-known brokers in the country, I got a hint of the extent to which Japanese stock prices are controlled. He was describing his favorite stock—I don’t remember what the name was—and he kept referring to a number—something like 100,000 yen. I wasn’t sure if he was talking about sales, earnings, or what, so I asked for clarification. It turned out he was picking the stock price 12 months hence. A year later, I checked, and he was exactly right. Japan was a nightmare for a fundamental analyst. I saw example after example of companies with bad balance sheets and spotty earnings, and overpriced stocks with wacky p/e ratios. At one point, 5 of the top 25 companies in Japan were brokerage houses, and another 5 to 10 were banks. \"",

        "body": "**STOCKS IN GENERAL**\n\n• The p/e ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company and for similar companies in the same industry.\n\n• The percentage of institutional ownership. The lower the better.\n\n• Whether insiders are buying and whether the company itself is buying back its own shares. Both are positive signs.\n\n• The record of earnings growth to date and whether the earnings are sporadic or consistent. (The only category where earnings may not be important is in the asset play.)\n\n• Whether the company has a strong balance sheet or a weak balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio) and how it’s rated for financial strength.\n\n• The cash position. With $16 in net cash, I know Ford is unlikely to drop below $16 a share. That’s the floor on the stock.\n\n**SLOW GROWERS**\n\n• Since you buy these for the dividends (why else would you own them?) you want to check to see if dividends have always been paid, and whether they are routinely raised.\n\n• When possible, find out what percentage of the earnings are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a low percentage, then the company has a cushion in hard times. It can earn less money and still retain the dividend. If it’s a high percentage, then the dividend is riskier.\n\n**STALWARTS**\n\n• These are big companies that aren’t likely to go out of business. The key issue is price, and the p/e ratio will tell you whether you are paying too much.\n\n• Check for possible diworseifications that may reduce earnings in the future.\n\n• Check the company’s long-term growth rate, and whether it has kept up the same momentum in recent years.\n\n• If you plan to hold the stock forever, see how the company has fared during previous recessions and market drops. (McDonald’s did well in the 1977 break, and in the 1984 break it went sideways. In the big Sneeze of 1987, it got blown away with the rest. Overall it’s been a good defensive stock. Bristol-Myers got clobbered in the 1973–74 break, primarily because it was so overpriced. It did well in 1982, 1984, and 1987. Kellogg has survived all the recent debacles, except for ’73–’74, in relatively healthy fashion.)\n\n**CYCLICALS**\n\n• Keep a close watch on inventories, and the supply-demand relationship. Watch for new entrants into the market, which is usually a dangerous development.\n\n• Anticipate a shrinking p/e multiple over time as business recovers and investors look ahead to the end of the cycle, when peak earnings are achieved.\n\n• If you know your cyclical, you have an advantage in figuring out the cycles. (For instance, everyone knows there are cycles in the auto industry. Eventually there are going to be three or four up years to follow three or four down years. There always are. Cars get older and they have to be replaced. People can put off replacing cars for a year or two longer than expected, but sooner or later they are back in the dealerships. But it’s much easier to predict an upturn in a cyclical industry than it is to predict a downturn.)\n\n**FAST GROWERS**\n\n• Investigate whether the product that’s supposed to enrich the company is a major part of the company’s business. It was with L’eggs, but not with Lexan.\n\n• What the growth rate in earnings has been in recent years. (My favorites are the ones in the 20 to 25 percent range. I’m wary of companies that seem to be growing faster than 25 percent. Those 50 percenters usually are found in hot industries, and you know what that means.)\n\n• That the company has duplicated its successes in more than one city or town, to prove that expansion will work.\n\n• That the company still has room to grow. When I first visited Pic ’N’ Save, they were established in southern California and were just beginning to talk about expanding into northern California. There were forty-nine other states to go. Sears, on the other hand, is everywhere.\n\n• Whether the stock is selling at a p/e ratio at or near the growth rate.\n\n• Whether the expansion is speeding up (three new motels last year and five new motels this year) or slowing down (five last year and three this year). For stocks of companies such as Sensormatic Electronics, whose sales are primarily “one-shot” deals—as opposed to razor blades, which customers have to keep on buying—a slowdown in growth can be devastating.\n\n**\n**\n**TURNAROUNDS**\n\n• Most important, can the company survive a raid by its creditors? How much cash does the company have? How much debt? (Apple Computer had $200 million in cash and no debt at the time of its crisis, so once again you knew it wasn’t going out of business.) What is the debt structure, and how long can it operate in the red while working out its problems without going bankrupt? (International Harvester— now Navistar—was a potential turnaround that has disappointed investors, because the company printed and sold millions of new shares to raise capital. This dilution resulted in the company’s having turned around, but not the stock.)\n\n• If it’s bankrupt already, then what’s left for the shareholders?\n\n• How is the company supposed to be turning around? Has it rid itself of unprofitable divisions?\n\n• Is business coming back?\n• Are costs being cut? If so, what will the effect be?\n\n**ASSET PLAYS**\n• What’s the value of the assets? Are there any hidden assets?\n\n• How much debt is there to detract from these assets? (Creditors are first in line.)\n\n• Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?\n\n• Is there a raider in the wings to help shareholders reap the benefits of the assets?",

        "body": "**High Ambition**\n\nOur society has always accorded negative connotations to the word ‘ambition’.This is the biggest obstacle in an entrepreneur’s path. Ambition whets your appetite for success, and that hunger propels you ahead.\n\n**Organization building**\n\nYou cannot achieve huge goals single-handedly. You need an organization for that. You need a group of experts.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nI have encountered many challenges and situations in my professional life that made me feel weak inwardly. I was often overcome with fear of losing the battle. Nevertheless, I never gave up. I have unflinching commitment to my objectives, regardless of the challenges I face. If one project does not work out, I am always prepared to switch to the next one to achieve my goals.\n\n**Market astuteness**\n\nBusiness does not run on the lines of elaborate theories outlined in thick books. Books may be helpful in generating business experts, but not businesspersons. One becomes a businessperson through market awareness\n\n**Conservatism brings benefits**\n\nConsider the positive aspects before getting into a project but, once you embark on it, you should focus on the negative aspects such as the challenges to be faced and the likely response of competitors. Identify the possible or imminent problems to duly address them. Start to mull over contingency plans. If you do not have contingency plans, then you might end up losing what you already have.\n\n**Restlessness ruins negotiation**\n\nThe more you appear restless at the negotiating table, the more you lose. The person in front of you tries his best to corner you. A deal hinges a lot on how you talk and how you present yourself. I give the highest priority to my terms, my competence and my stake when I negotiate. For instance, when I am seeking fifty points, I will start asking for 100. In most cases, I succeed in striking a deal at seventy-five. Also, since everybody wants the best deal in\n\nnegotiations, you can get a better deal if you can create a win-win situation for both sides. Making unnecessary demands can  lead to failed negotiations.\n\n**Nothing succeeds like success**\n\nAs the saying goes, nothing succeeds like success. If you become successful in any venture, more successes will follow. You have to create a strong success story for the world to see if you want to establish yourself in business. You should create a persona that persuades others to trust you. However, if you try your hand at a new venture before your earlier business is established, you will not make your mark in the market. Try to look for a complementary sector when you are ready for a new venture. Put in a lot of extra effort if you venture into a field in which you do not have sufficient experience.\n\n**Costs must be pruned**\nWork quietly and cost effectively.\n\n**Discipline**\n\nDiscipline is about two things: personal conduct and time management. How do you conduct yourself with your colleagues? How do you present yourself before your partners, sales agents and buyers? These things determine your personal discipline. Talking idly with everyone you come across will diminish your stature. You need to strike a balance between respect, affection and fear when it comes to your relationship with your employees. Time is the most precious thing in this world. You cannot get it back when it is gone, regardless of how much you are willing to pay. Do not forget that life is not just about business. We also have family and friends, and personal and social lives. You have to optimize the time you have allotted to your professional life to your maximum benefit so that you still have time left over for other things in life. If you cannot handle the most precious thing in the world with care, you may not be able to handle other matters either.\n\n**Keep yourself updated**\n\nSelf-learning is important. Learn from observing others. Mingle with a lot of people. Make new friends wherever you go. Listen to them attentively. Study them carefully. Learn their tricks. They are a business school. Those who are happy limiting themselves to a narrow sphere cannot be big-timers. It is really important to keep yourself updated and stay abreast of what is going on around you. The more you are in step with the world outside, the more your personality shines. Always strive to overcome your weaknesses so that you can grow as a person. Never shy away from learning things you do not know anything about. Be am an avid reader. Try to collect information on many subjects that I feel may come in handy at some point.\"\n\n**\n**",

A week later he returned to report that whenever he met anyone who triggered his anticipatory anxiety, he said to himself, “I only sweated out a quart before, but now I’m going to pour at least ten quarts!” The result was that, after suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself permanently of it within one week.\n\nThe reader will note that this procedure consists of a reversal of the\n\npatient’s attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety. Such a procedure, however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor.

Extend the\nhead as far to the left and right, and as close to the chest and back\nas possible. Loosen up those neck joints!\n4. In the standing position, arms stretched out horizontally away from\nthe body, rotate the arms in a circle approximately 2 feet in diameter.\nKeep the arms extended to the side, and do not bend the elbows.\nRotate the arms from the shoulder joints. After several rotations,\nrotate the arms in the opposite direction several more times. Extend\nthe arms as far backwards as possible during each rotation.\n5. Stand away from all walls or other objects with your feet about 18\ninches apart. Allow your head to fall loosely backwards as far as it will\ngo without straining your neck. Raise both arms sideways, away from\nthe body, and stretch them outward as far as they will go. Hold them\nthere, level with your shoulders. Start the exercise by swinging your\ntorso all the way to the left, and then all the way to the right. Keep\nyour arms stiff and straight. Keep performing this swinging\nmovement, to the left, to the right, then left, then right, left, right. Do it\nnaturally and smoothly.

In 1917, at a time when the Russian upper and middle classes numbered at least 3 million people, the Communist Party had just 23,000 members. 19 The communists nevertheless gained control of the vast Russian Empire because they organised themselves well. When authority in Russia slipped from the decrepit hands of the tsar and the equally shaky hands of Kerensky’s provisional government, the communists seized it with alacrity, gripping the reins of power like a bulldog locking its jaws on a bone.\"",

They also work well in the lab, where you test them on small groups of people.

Because large numbers of people behave in a fundamentally different way than do small numbers.\n\nWhat would scientists see if they conducted the Ultimatum Game experiment on two groups of 1 million people each, who had to share $100 billion? They would probably have witnessed strange and fascinating dynamics. For example, since 1 million people cannot make decisions collectively, each group might sprout a small ruling elite. What if one elite offers the other $10 billion, keeping $90 billion? The leaders of the second group might well accept this unfair offer, siphon most of the $10 billion into their Swiss bank accounts, while preventing rebellion among their followers with a combination of sticks and carrots. The leadership might threaten to severely punish dissidents forthwith, while promising the meek and patient everlasting rewards in the afterlife. This is what happened in ancient Egypt and eighteenth-century Prussia, and this is how things still work out in numerous countries around the world. Such threats and promises often succeed in creating stable human hierarchies and mass-cooperation networks, as long as people believe that they reflect the inevitable laws of nature or the divine commands of God, rather than just human whims.

And why do all these people think it is meaningful? Because their friends and neighbours also share the same view. People constantly reinforce each other’s beliefs in a self-perpetuating loop. Each round of mutual confirmation tightens the web of meaning further, until you have little choice but to believe what everyone else believes. Yet over decades and centuries the web of meaning unravels and a new web is spun in its place. To study history means to watch the spinning and unravelling of these webs, and to realise that what seems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their descendants.\n\nIn 1187 Saladin defeated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin and conquered Jerusalem. In response the Pope launched the Third Crusade to recapture the holy city. Imagine a young English nobleman named John, who left home to fight Saladin. John believed that his actions had an objective meaning. He believed that if he died on the crusade, after death his soul would ascend to heaven, where it would enjoy everlasting celestial joy. He would have been horrified to learn that the soul and heaven are just stories invented by humans. John wholeheartedly believed that if he reached the Holy Land, and if some Muslim warrior with a big moustache brought an axe down on his head, he would feel an unbearable pain, his ears would ring, his legs would crumble under him, his field of vision would turn black – and the very next moment he would see brilliant light all around him, he would hear angelic voices and melodious harps, and radiant winged cherubs would beckon him through a magnificent golden gate.\n\nJohn had a very strong faith in all this, because he was enmeshed within an extremely dense and powerful web of meaning. His earliest memories were of Grandpa Henry’s rusty sword, hanging in the castle’s main hall. Ever since he was a toddler John had heard stories of Grandpa Henry who died on the Second Crusade and who is now resting with the angels in heaven, watching over John and his family. When minstrels visited the castle, they usually sang about the brave crusaders who fought in the Holy Land. When John went to church, he enjoyed looking at the stained-glass windows. One showed Godfrey of Bouillon riding a horse and impaling a wicked-looking Muslim on his lance. Another showed the souls of sinners burning in hell. John listened attentively to the local priest, the most learned man he knew. Almost every Sunday, the priest explained – with the help of well-crafted parables and hilarious jokes – that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church, that the Pope in Rome was our holy father and that we always had to obey his commands. If we murdered or stole, God would send us to hell; but if we killed infidel Muslims, God would welcome us to heaven. One day when John was just turning eighteen a dishevelled knight rode to the castle’s gate, and in a choked voice announced the news: Saladin has destroyed the crusader army at Hattin! Jerusalem has fallen! The Pope has declared a new crusade, promising eternal salvation to anyone who dies on it! All around, people looked shocked and worried, but John’s face lit up in an otherworldly glow and he proclaimed: ‘I am going to fight the infidels and liberate the Holy Land!’ Everyone fell silent for a moment, and then smiles and tears appeared on their faces. His mother wiped her eyes, gave John a big hug and told him how proud she was of him. His father gave him a mighty pat on the back, and said: ‘If only I was your age, son, I would join you. Our family’s honour is at stake – I am sure you won’t disappoint us!’ Two of his friends announced that they were coming too. Even John’s sworn rival, the baron on the other side of the river, paid a visit to wish him Godspeed.\n\nAs he left the castle, villagers came forth from their hovels to wave to him, and all the pretty girls looked longingly at the brave crusader setting off to fight the infidels. When he set sail from England and made his way through strange and distant lands – Normandy, Provence, Sicily – he was joined by bands of foreign knights, all with the same destination and the same faith. When the army finally disembarked in the Holy Land and waged battle with Saladin’s hosts, John was amazed to discover that even the wicked Saracens shared his beliefs. True, they were a bit confused, thinking that the Christians were the infidels and that the Muslims were obeying God’s will. Yet they too accepted the basic principle that those fighting for God and Jerusalem will go straight to heaven when they die. In such a way, thread by thread, medieval civilisation spun its web of meaning, trapping John and his contemporaries like flies. It was inconceivable to John that all these stories were just figments of the imagination. Maybe his parents and uncles were wrong. But the minstrels too, and all his friends, and the village girls, the learned priest, the baron on the other side of the river, the Pope in Rome, the Provençal and Sicilian knights, and even the very Muslims – is it possible that they were all hallucinating?\n\nAnd the years pass. As the historian watches, the web of meaning unravels and another is spun in its stead. John’s parents die, followed by all his siblings and friends. Instead of minstrels singing about the crusades, the new fashion is stage plays about tragic love affairs. The family castle burns to the ground and, when it is rebuilt, no trace is found of Grandpa Henry’s sword. The church windows shatter in a winter storm and the replacement glass no longer depicts Godfrey of Bouillon and the sinners in hell, but rather the great triumph of the king of England over the king of France. The local priest has stopped calling the Pope ‘our holy father’ – he is now referred to as ‘that devil in Rome’. In the nearby university scholars pore over ancient Greek manuscripts, dissect dead bodies and whisper quietly behind closed doors that perhaps there is no such thing as the soul. And the years continue to pass. Where the castle once stood, there is now a shopping mall. In the local cinema they are screening Monty Python and the Holy Grail for the umpteenth time. In an empty church a bored vicar is overjoyed to see two Japanese tourists. He explains at length about the stained-glass windows, while they politely smile, nodding in complete incomprehension. On the steps outside a gaggle of teenagers are playing with their iPhones. They watch a new YouTube remix of John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’. ‘Imagine there’s no heaven,’ sings Lennon, ‘it’s easy if you try.’ A Pakistani street cleaner is sweeping the pavement, while a nearby radio broadcasts the news: the carnage in Syria continues, and the Security Council’s meeting has ended in an impasse. Suddenly a hole in time opens, a mysterious ray of light illuminates the face of one of the teenagers, who announces: ‘I am going to fight the infidels and liberate the Holy Land!’\n\nInfidels and Holy Land? These words no longer carry any meaning for most people in today’s England. Even the vicar would probably think the teenager is having some sort of psychotic episode. In contrast, if an English youth decided to join Amnesty International and travel to Syria to protect the human rights of refugees, he will be seen as a hero. In the Middle Ages people would have thought he had gone bonkers. Nobody in twelfth-century England knew what human rights were. You want to travel to the Middle East and risk your life not in order to kill Muslims, but to protect one group of Muslims from another? You must be out of your mind. That’s how history unfolds. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously. With hindsight, going on crusade in the hope of reaching Paradise sounds like utter madness. With hindsight, the Cold War seems even madder. How come thirty years ago people were willing to risk nuclear holocaust because of their belief in a communist paradise? A hundred years hence, our belief in democracy and human rights might look equally incomprehensible to our descendants.\"",

They cannot imagine things that they have never seen or smelled or tasted – such as the US dollar, Google corporation or the European Union. Only Sapiens can imagine such chimeras.\n\nAs well as separating humans from other animals, this ability to create intersubjective entities also separates the humanities from the life sciences. Historians seek to understand the development of intersubjective entities like gods and nations, whereas biologists hardly recognise the existence of such things. Some believe that if we could only crack the genetic code and map every neuron in the brain, we will know all of humanity’s secrets. After all, if humans have no soul, and if thoughts, emotions and sensations are just biochemical algorithms, why can’t biology account for all the vagaries of human societies? From this perspective, the crusades were territorial disputes shaped by evolutionary pressures, and English knights going to fight Saladin in the Holy Land were not that different from wolves trying to appropriate the territory of a neighbouring pack. The humanities, in contrast, emphasise the crucial importance of intersubjective entities, which cannot be reduced to hormones and neurons. To think historically means to ascribe real power to the contents of our imaginary stories. Of course, historians don’t ignore objective factors such as climate changes and genetic mutations, but they give much greater importance to the stories people invent and believe. North Korea and South Korea are so different from one another not because people in Pyongyang have different genes to people in Seoul, or because the north is colder and more mountainous. It’s because the north is dominated by very different fictions.\n\nMaybe someday breakthroughs in neurobiology will enable us to explain communism and the crusades in strictly biochemical terms. Yet we are very far from that point. During the twenty-first century the border between history and biology is likely to blur not because we will discover biological explanations for historical events, but rather because ideological fictions will rewrite DNA strands; political and economic interests will redesign the climate; and the geography of mountains and rivers will give way to cyberspace. As human fictions are translated into genetic and electronic codes, the intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will merge with history. In the twenty-first century fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection. Hence if we want to understand our future, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions that give meaning to the world. \"",

Their daily reality consisted of ink marks on papyrus scrolls, which determined who owned which field, how much an ox cost and what yearly taxes peasants had to pay. A scribe could decide the fate of an entire village with a stroke of his stylus.\n\nThe vast majority of people remained illiterate until the modern age, but the all-important administrators increasingly saw reality through the medium of written texts.

In order to cross the border south, they needed visas to Spain and Portugal, and tens of thousands of Jews, along with many other refugees, besieged the Portuguese consulate in Bordeaux in a desperate attempt to get the life-saving piece of paper. The Portuguese government forbade its consuls in France to issue visas without prior approval from the Foreign Ministry, but the consul in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, decided to disregard the order, throwing to the wind a thirty-year diplomatic career. As Nazi tanks were closing in on Bordeaux, Sousa Mendes and his team worked around the clock for ten days and nights, barely stopping to sleep, just issuing visas and stamping pieces of paper. Sousa Mendes issued thousands of visas before collapsing from exhaustion. The Portuguese government – which had little desire to accept any of these refugees – sent agents to escort the disobedient consul back home, and fired him from the foreign office. Yet officials who cared little for the plight of human beings nevertheless had deep respect for documents, and the visas Sousa Mendes issued against orders were respected by French, Spanish and Portuguese bureaucrats alike, spiriting up to 30,000 people out of the Nazi death trap.

If you obey God, you’ll be admitted to heaven. If you disobey Him, you’ll burn in hell.’ The very clarity of this deal allows society to define common norms and values that regulate human behaviour. Spiritual journeys are nothing like that. They usually take people in mysterious ways towards unknown destinations. The quest usually begins with some big question, such as who am I? What is the meaning of life? What is good? Whereas many people just accept the ready-made answers provided by the powers that be, spiritual seekers are not so easily satisfied. They are determined to follow the big question wherever it leads, and not just to places you know well or wish to visit.\n\nSuch journeys are fundamentally different from religions, because religions seek to cement the worldly order whereas spirituality seeks to escape it. Often enough, the most important demand from spiritual wanderers is to challenge the beliefs and conventions of dominant religions. In Zen Buddhism it is said that ‘If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.’ Which means that if while walking on the spiritual path you encounter the rigid ideas and fixed laws of institutionalised Buddhism, you must free yourself from them too.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, the spiritual journey is always tragic, for it is a lonely path fit for individuals rather than for entire societies. Human cooperation requires firm answers rather than just questions, and those who foam against stultified religious structures end up forging new structures in their place. It happened to the dualists, whose spiritual journeys became religious establishments. It happened to Martin Luther, who after challenging the laws, institutions and rituals of the Catholic Church found himself writing new law books, founding new institutions and inventing new ceremonies. It happened even to Buddha and Jesus. In their uncompromising quest for the truth they subverted the laws, rituals and structures of traditional Hinduism and Judaism.

However, if an animal ‘freely’ chooses what to eat and with whom to mate, then natural selection is left with nothing to work on. When confronted with such scientific explanations, people often brush them aside, pointing out that they feel free, and that they act according to their own wishes and decisions. This is true. Humans act according to their desires. If by ‘free will’ you mean the ability to act according to your desires – then yes, humans have free will, and so do chimpanzees, dogs and parrots. When Polly wants a cracker, Polly eats a cracker. But the million-dollar question is not whether parrots and humans can act out their inner desires – the question is whether they can choose their desires in the first place.Why does Polly want a cracker rather than a cucumber?

        "body": "This enables the scientists to manoeuvre the rat by remote control. After short training sessions, researchers have managed not only to make the rats turn left or right, but also to climb ladders, sniff around garbage piles, and do things that rats normally dislike, such as jumping from great heights. Armies and corporations show keen interest in the robo-rats, hoping they could prove useful in many tasks and situations. For example, robo-rats could help detect survivors trapped under collapsed buildings, locate bombs and booby traps, and map underground tunnels and caves. Animal-welfare activists have voiced concern about the suffering such experiments inflict on the rats. Professor Sanjiv Talwar of the State University of New York, one of the leading robo-rat researchers, has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the rats actually enjoy the experiments. After all, explains Talwar, the rats ‘work for pleasure’ and when the electrodes stimulate the reward centre in their brain, ‘the rat feels Nirvana’. 3 To the best of our understanding, the rat doesn’t feel that somebody else controls her, and she doesn’t feel that she is being coerced to do something against her will. When Professor Talwar presses the remote control, the rat wants to move to the left, which is why she moves to the left. When the professor presses another switch, the rat wants to climb a ladder, which is why she climbs the ladder. After all, the rat’s desires are nothing but a pattern of firing neurons. What does it matter whether the neurons are firing because they are stimulated by other neurons, or because they are stimulated by transplanted electrodes connected to Professor Talwar’s remote control? If you asked the rat about it, she might well have told you, ‘Sure I have free will! Look, I want to turn left – and I turn left. I want to climb a ladder – and I climb a ladder. Doesn’t that prove that I have free will?’ \n\nExperiments performed on Homo sapiens indicate that like rats humans too can be manipulated, and that it is possible to create or annihilate even complex feelings such as love, anger, fear and depression by stimulating the right spots in the human brain. The US military has recently initiated experiments on implanting computer chips in people’s brains, hoping to use this method to treat soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, doctors have pioneered a novel treatment for patients suffering from acute depression. They implant electrodes into the patient’s brain, and wire the electrodes to a minuscule computer implanted into the patient’s breast. On receiving a command from the computer, the electrodes use weak electric currents to paralyse the brain area responsible for the depression. The treatment does not always succeed, but in some cases patients reported that the feeling of dark emptiness that tormented them throughout their lives disappeared as if by magic.\n\nOne patient complained that several months after the operation, he had a relapse, and was overcome by severe depression. Upon inspection, the doctors found the source of the problem: the computer’s battery had run out of power. Once they changed the battery, the depression quickly melted away. 5 Due to obvious ethical restrictions, researchers implant electrodes into human brains only under special circumstances. Hence most relevant experiments on humans are conducted using non-intrusive helmet-like devices (technically known as ‘transcranial direct current stimulators’). The helmet is fitted with electrodes that attach to the scalp from outside. It produces weak electromagnetic fields and directs them towards specific brain areas, thereby stimulating or inhibiting select brain activities. The American military experiments with such helmets in the hope of sharpening the focus and enhancing the performance of soldiers both in training sessions and on the battlefield. The main experiments are conducted in the Human Effectiveness Directorate, which is located in an Ohio air force base. Though the results are far from conclusive, and though the hype around transcranial stimulators currently runs far ahead of actual achievements, several studies have indicated that the method may indeed enhance the cognitive abilities of drone operators, air-traffic controllers, snipers and other personnel whose duties require them to remain highly attentive for extended periods.\n\nSally Adee, a journalist for the New Scientist, was allowed to visit a training facility for snipers and test the effects herself. At first, she entered a battlefield simulator without wearing the transcranial helmet. Sally describes how fear swept over her as she saw twenty masked men, strapped with suicide bombs and armed with rifles, charge straight towards her. ‘For every one I manage to shoot dead,’ writes Sally, ‘three new assailants pop up from nowhere. I’m clearly not shooting fast enough, and panic and incompetence are making me continually jam my rifle.’ Luckily for her, the assailants were just video images, projected on huge screens all around her. Still, she was so disappointed with her poor performance that she felt like putting down the rifle and leaving the simulator. Then they wired her up to the helmet. She reports feeling nothing unusual, except a slight tingle and a strange metallic taste in her mouth. Yet she began picking off the terrorists one by one, as coolly and methodically as if she were Rambo or Clint Eastwood. ‘As twenty of them run at me brandishing their guns, I calmly line up my rifle, take a moment to breathe deeply, and pick off the closest one, before tranquilly assessing my next target. In what seems like next to no time, I hear a voice call out, “Okay, that’s it.” The lights come up in the simulation room . . . In the sudden quiet amid the bodies around me, I was really expecting more assailants, and I’m a bit disappointed when the team begins to remove my electrodes. I look up and wonder if someone wound the clocks forward. Inexplicably, twenty minutes have just passed. “How many did I get?” I ask the assistant. She looks at me quizzically. “All of them.”’ \"",

        "body": "The narrating self is the star of Jorge Luis Borges’s story ‘A Problem’. 19 The story deals with Don Quixote, the eponymous hero of Miguel Cervantes’s famous novel. Don Quixote creates for himself an imaginary world in which he is a legendary champion going forth to fight giants and save Lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In reality, Don Quixote is Alonso Quixano, an elderly country gentleman; the noble Dulcinea is an uncouth farm girl from a nearby village; and the giants are windmills. What would happen, wonders Borges, if out of his belief in these fantasies, Don Quixote attacks and kills a real person? Borges asks a fundamental question about the human condition: what happens when the yarns spun by our narrating self cause great harm to ourselves or those around us? There are three main possibilities, says Borges.\n\nOne option is that nothing much happens. Don Quixote will not be bothered at all by killing a real man. His delusions are so overpowering that he could not tell the difference between this incident and his imaginary duel with the windmill giants.\n\nAnother option is that once he takes a real life, Don Quixote will be so horrified that he will be shaken out of his delusions. This is akin to a young recruit who goes to war believing that it is good to die for one’s country, only to be completely disillusioned by the realities of warfare.\n\nAnd there is a third option, much more complex and profound. As long as he fought imaginary giants, Don Quixote was just play-acting, but once he actually kills somebody, he will cling to his fantasies for all he is worth, because they are the only thing giving meaning to his terrible crime. Paradoxically, the more sacrifices we make for an imaginary story, the stronger the story becomes, because we desperately want to give meaning to these sacrifices and to the suffering we have caused.\n\nIn politics this is known as the ‘Our Boys Didn’t Die in Vain’ syndrome. In 1915 Italy entered the First World War on the side of the Entente powers. Italy’s declared aim was to ‘liberate’ Trento and Trieste – two ‘Italian’ territories that the Austro-Hungarian Empire held ‘unjustly’. Italian politicians gave fiery speeches in parliament, vowing historical redress and promising a return to the glories of ancient Rome. Hundreds of thousands of Italian recruits went to the front shouting, ‘For Trento and Trieste!’ They thought it would be a walkover. It was anything but. The Austro-Hungarian army held a strong defensive line along the Isonzo River. The Italians hurled themselves against the line in eleven gory battles, gaining a few kilometres at most, and never securing a breakthrough. In the first battle they lost 15,000 men. In the second battle they lost 40,000 men. In the third battle they lost 60,000. So it continued for more than two dreadful years until the eleventh engagement, when the Austrians finally counter-attacked, and in the Battle of Caporreto soundly defeated the Italians and pushed them back almost to the gates of Venice. The glorious adventure became a bloodbath. By the end of the war, almost 700,000 Italian soldiers were killed, and more than a million were wounded. After losing the first Isonzo battle, Italian politicians had two choices. They could admit their mistake and sign a peace treaty. Austria–Hungary had no claims against Italy, and would have been delighted to sign a peace treaty because it was busy fighting for survival against the much stronger Russians. Yet how could the politicians go to the parents, wives and children of 15,000 dead Italian soldiers, and tell them: ‘Sorry, there has been a mistake. We hope you don’t take it too hard, but your Giovanni died in vain, and so did your Marco.’ Alternatively they could say: ‘Giovanni and Marco were heroes! They died so that Trieste would be Italian, and we will make sure they didn’t die in vain. We will go on fighting until victory is ours!’ Not surprisingly, the politicians preferred the second option. So they fought a second battle, and lost another 40,000 men. The politicians again decided it would be best to keep on fighting, because ‘our boys didn’t die in vain’\n\nYet you cannot blame only the politicians. The masses also kept supporting the war. And when after the war Italy did not get all the territories it demanded, Italian democracy placed at its head Benito Mussolini and his fascists, who promised they would gain for Italy a proper compensation for all the sacrifices it had made. While it’s hard for a politician to tell parents that their son died for no good reason, it is far more difficult for parents to say this to themselves – and it is even harder for the victims. A crippled soldier who lost his legs would rather tell himself, ‘I sacrificed myself for the glory of the eternal Italian nation!’ than ‘I lost my legs because I was stupid enough to believe self-serving politicians.’ It is much easier to live with the fantasy, because the fantasy gives meaning to the suffering.\n\nPriests discovered this principle thousands of years ago. It underlies numerous religious ceremonies and commandments. If you want to make people believe in imaginary entities such as gods and nations, you should make them sacrifice something valuable. The more painful the sacrifice, the more convinced people are of the existence of the imaginary recipient. A poor peasant sacrificing a priceless bull to Jupiter will become convinced that Jupiter really exists, otherwise how can he excuse his stupidity? The peasant will sacrifice another bull, and another, and another, just so he won’t have to admit that all the previous bulls were wasted. For exactly the same reason, if I have sacrificed a child to the glory of the Italian nation, or my legs to the communist revolution, it’s enough to turn me into a zealous Italian nationalist or an enthusiastic communist. For if Italian national myths or communist propaganda are a lie, then I will be forced to admit that my child’s death or my own paralysis have been completely pointless. Few people have the stomach to admit such a thing.\n\nNot only governments fall into this trap. Business corporations often sink millions into failed enterprises, while private individuals cling to dysfunctional marriages and dead-end jobs. For the narrating self would much prefer to go on suffering in the future, just so it won’t have to admit that our past suffering was devoid of all meaning. Eventually, if we want to come clean about past mistakes, our narrating self must invent some twist in the plot that will infuse these mistakes with meaning. For example, a pacifist war veteran may tell himself, ‘Yes, I’ve lost my legs because of a mistake. But thanks to this mistake, I understand that war is hell, and from now onwards I will dedicate my life to fight for peace. So my injury did have some positive meaning: it taught me to value peace.' \"",

Only conscious beings could perform tasks that required a lot of intelligence, such as playing chess, driving cars, diagnosing diseases or identifying terrorists. However, we are now developing new types of non-conscious intelligence that can perform such tasks far better than humans. For all these tasks are based on pattern recognition, and non-conscious algorithms may soon excel human consciousness in recognising patterns. This raises a novel question: which of the two is really important, intelligence or consciousness? As long as they went hand in hand, debating their relative value was just a pastime for philosophers. But in the twenty-first century, this is becoming an urgent political and economic issue. And it is sobering to realise that, at least for armies and corporations, the answer is straightforward: intelligence is mandatory but consciousness is optional.\n\nArmies and corporations cannot function without intelligent agents, but they don’t need consciousness and subjective experiences. The conscious experiences of a flesh-and-blood taxi driver are infinitely richer than those of a self-driving car, which feels absolutely nothing. The taxi driver can enjoy music while navigating the busy streets of Seoul. His mind may expand in awe as he looks up at the stars and contemplates the mysteries of the universe. His eyes may fill with tears of joy when he sees his baby girl taking her very first step. But the system doesn’t need all that from a taxi driver. All it really wants is to bring passengers from point A to point B as quickly, safely and cheaply as possible. And the autonomous car will soon be able to do that far better than a human driver, even though it cannot enjoy music or be awestruck by the magic of existence. Indeed, if we forbid humans to drive taxis and cars altogether, and give computer algorithms monopoly over traffic, we can then connect all vehicles to a single network, and thereby make car accidents virtually impossible. \"",

        "body": "But maybe you don’t need convincing, especially if you are under twenty. People just want to be part of the data flow, even if that means giving up their privacy, their autonomy and their individuality. Humanist art sanctifies the individual genius, and a Picasso doodle on a napkin nets millions at Sotheby’s. Humanist science glorifies the individual researcher, and every scholar dreams of putting his or her name at the top of a Science or Nature paper. But a growing number of artistic and scientific creations are nowadays produced by the ceaseless collaboration of ‘everyone’. Who writes Wikipedia? All of us. The individual is becoming a tiny chip inside a giant system that nobody really understands. Every day I absorb countless data bits through emails, phone calls and articles; process the data; and transmit back new bits through more emails, phone calls and articles. I don’t really know where I fit into the great scheme of things, and how my bits of data connect with the bits produced by billions of other humans and computers. I don’t have time to find out, because I am too busy answering all the emails. And as I process more data more efficiently – answering more emails, making more phone calls and writing more articles – so the people around me are flooded by even more data. This relentless flow of data sparks new inventions and disruptions that nobody plans, controls or comprehends. No one understands how the global economy functions or where global politics is heading. But no one needs to understand. All you need to do is answer your emails faster – and allow the system to read them. Just as free-market capitalists believe in the invisible hand of the market, so Dataists believe in the invisible hand of the data flow. As the global data-processing system becomes all-knowing and all-powerful, so connecting to the system becomes the source of all meaning. Humans want to merge into the data flow because when you are part of the data flow you are part of something much bigger than yourself. Traditional religions told you that your every word and action was part of some great cosmic plan, and that God watched you every minute and cared about all your thoughts and feelings. Data religion now says that your every word and action is part of the great data flow, that the algorithms are constantly watching you and that they care about everything you do and feel. Most people like this very much. For true-believers, to be disconnected from the data flow risks losing the very meaning of life. What’s the point of doing or experiencing anything if nobody knows about it, and if it doesn’t contribute something to the global exchange of information? Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do. Twenty years ago Japanese tourists were a universal laughing stock because they always carried cameras and took pictures of everything in sight. Now everyone is doing it. If you go to India and see an elephant, you don’t look at the elephant and ask yourself, ‘What do I feel?’ – you are too busy looking for your smartphone, taking a picture of the elephant, posting it on Facebook and then checking your account every two minutes to see how many Likes you got. Writing a private diary – a common humanist practice in previous generations – sounds to many present\u0002day youngsters utterly pointless. Why write anything if nobody else can read it? The new motto says: ‘If you experience something – record it. If you record something – upload it. If you upload something – share it.’ Throughout this book we have repeatedly asked what makes humans superior to other animals. Dataism has a new and simple answer. In themselves, human experiences are not superior at all to the experiences of wolves or elephants. One bit of data is as good as another. However, a human can write a poem about his experience and post it online, thereby enriching the global data\u0002processing system. That makes his bits count. A wolf cannot do this. Hence all of the wolf’s experiences – as deep and complex as they may be – are worthless. No wonder we are so busy converting our experiences into data. It isn’t a question of trendiness. It is a question of survival. We must prove to ourselves and to the system that we still have value. And value lies not in having experiences, but in turning these experiences into free-flowing data.\n\nKnow Thyself\n\nDataism is neither liberal nor humanist. It should be emphasised, however, that Dataism isn’t anti-humanist. It has nothing against human experiences. It just doesn’t think they are intrinsically valuable. When we surveyed the three main humanist sects, we asked which experience is the most valuable: listening to Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, to Chuck Berry, to a pygmy initiation song or to the howl of a wolf in heat. A Dataist would argue that the entire exercise is misguided, because music should be evaluated according to the data it carries rather than according to the experience it creates. A Dataist may argue, for example, that the Fifth Symphony carries far more data than the pygmy initiation song, because it uses more chords and scales, and creates dialogues with many more musical styles. Consequently, you need far more computational power to decipher the Fifth Symphony, and you gain far more knowledge from doing so. Music, according to this view, is mathematical patterns. Mathematics can describe every musical piece, as well as the relations between any two pieces. Hence you can measure the precise data value of every symphony, song and howl, and determine which is the richest. The experiences they create in humans or wolves don’t really matter. True, for the last 70,000 years or so, human experiences have been the most efficient data-processing algorithms in the universe, hence there was good reason to sanctify them. However, we may soon reach a point when these algorithms will be superseded, and even become a burden. Sapiens evolved in the African savannah tens of thousands of years ago, and their algorithms are just not built to handle twenty-first-century data flows. We might try to upgrade the human data-processing system, but this may not be enough. The Internet-of-All-Things may soon create such huge and rapid data flows that even upgraded human algorithms cannot handle it. When the car replaced the horse-drawn carriage, we didn’t upgrade the horses – we retired them. Perhaps it is time to do the same with Homo sapiens. Dataism adopts a strictly functional approach to humanity, appraising the value of human experiences according to their function in data-processing mechanisms. If we develop an algorithm that fulfils the same function better, human experiences will lose their value. Thus if we can replace not just taxi drivers and doctors but also lawyers, poets and musicians with superior computer programs, why should we care if these programs have no consciousness and no subjective experiences? If some humanist starts adulating the sacredness of human experience, Dataists would dismiss such sentimental humbug. ‘The experience you praise is just an outdated biochemical algorithm. In the African savannah 70,000 years ago, that algorithm was state\u0002of-the-art. Even in the twentieth century it was vital for the army and for the economy. But soon we will have much better algorithms.’ In the climactic scene of many Hollywood science-fiction movies, humans face an alien invasion fleet, an army of rebellious robots or an all-knowing super- computer that wants to obliterate them. Humanity seems doomed. But at the very last moment, against all the odds, humanity triumphs thanks to something that the aliens, the robots and the super-computers didn’t suspect and cannot fathom: love. The hero, who up till now has been easily manipulated by the super-computer and has been riddled with bullets by the evil robots, is inspired by his sweetheart to make a completely unexpected move that turns the tables on the thunderstruck Matrix. Dataism finds such scenarios utterly ridiculous. ‘Come on,’ it admonishes the Hollywood screenwriters, ‘is that all you could come up with? Love? And not even some platonic cosmic love, but the carnal attraction between two mammals? Do you really think that an all-knowing super\u0002computer or aliens who managed to conquer the entire galaxy would be dumbfounded by a hormonal rush?’ By equating the human experience with data patterns, Dataism undermines our main source of authority and meaning, and heralds a tremendous religious revolution, the like of which has not been seen since the eighteenth century. In the days of Locke, Hume and Voltaire humanists argued that ‘God is a product of the human imagination’. Dataism now gives humanists a taste of their own medicine, and tells them: ‘Yes, God is a product of the human imagination, but human imagination in turn is the product of biochemical algorithms.’ In the eighteenth century, humanism sidelined God by shifting from a deo-centric to a homo-centric world view. In the twenty-first century, Dataism may sideline humans by shifting from a homo-centric to a data-centric view. The Dataist revolution will probably take a few decades, if not a century or two. But then the humanist revolution too did not happen overnight. At first, humans kept on believing in God, and argued that humans are sacred because they were created by God for some divine purpose. Only much later did some people dare say that humans are sacred in their own right, and that God doesn’t exist at all. Similarly, today most Dataists say that the Internet-of-All-Things is sacred because humans are creating it to serve human needs. But eventually, the Internet-of-All-Things may become sacred in its own right. The shift from a homo-centric to a data-centric world view won’t be merely a philosophical revolution. It will be a practical revolution. All truly important revolutions are practical. The humanist idea that ‘humans invented God’ was significant because it had far-reaching practical implications. Similarly, the Dataist idea that ‘organisms are algorithms’ is significant due to its day-to-day practical consequences. Ideas change the world only when they change our behaviour. In ancient Babylon, when people faced a difficult dilemma they climbed to the top of the local temple in the darkness of night and observed the sky. The Babylonians believed that the stars control our fate and predict our future. By watching the stars the Babylonians decided whether to get married, plough the field and go to war. Their philosophical beliefs were translated into very practical procedures. Scriptural religions such as Judaism and Christianity told a different story: ‘The stars are lying. God, who created the stars, revealed the entire truth in the Bible. So stop observing the stars – read the Bible instead!’ This too was a practical recommendation. When people didn’t know whom to marry, what career to choose and whether to start a war, they read the Bible and followed its counsel. Next came the humanists, with an altogether new story: ‘Humans invented God, wrote the Bible and then interpreted it in a thousand different ways. So humans themselves are the source of all truth. You may read the Bible as an inspiring human creation, but you don’t have to. If you are facing any dilemma, just listen to yourself and follow your inner voice.’ Humanism then gave detailed practical instructions on how to listen to yourself, recommending things such as watching sunsets, reading Goethe, keeping a private diary, having heart-to\u0002heart talks with a good friend and holding democratic elections. For centuries scientists too accepted these humanist guidelines. When physicists wondered whether to get married or not, they too watched sunsets and tried to get in touch with themselves. When chemists contemplated whether to accept a problematic job offer, they too wrote diaries and had heart-to-heart talks with a good friend. When biologists debated whether to wage war or sign a peace treaty, they too voted in democratic elections. When brain scientists wrote books about their startling discoveries, they often put an inspiring Goethe quote on the first page. This was the basis for the modern alliance between science and humanism, which kept the delicate balance between the modern yang and the modern yin – between reason and emotion, between the laboratory and the museum, between the production line and the supermarket. The scientists not only sanctified human feelings, but also found an excellent evolutionary reason to do so. After Darwin, biologists began explaining that feelings are complex algorithms honed by evolution to help animals make the right decisions. Our love, our fear and our passion aren’t some nebulous spiritual phenomena good only for composing poetry. Rather, they encapsulate millions of years of practical wisdom. When you read the Bible, you get advice from a few priests and rabbis who lived in ancient Jerusalem. In contrast, when you listen to your feelings, you follow an algorithm that evolution has developed for millions of years, and that withstood the harshest quality tests of natural selection. Your feelings are the voice of millions of ancestors, each of whom managed to survive and reproduce in an unforgiving environment. Your feelings are not infallible, of course, but they are better than most alternatives. For millions upon millions of years, feelings were the best algorithms in the world. Hence in the days of Confucius, of Muhammad or of Stalin, people should have listened to their feelings rather than to the teachings of Confucianism, Islam or communism. Yet in the twenty-first century, feelings are no longer the best algorithms in the world. We are developing superior algorithms which utilise unprecedented computing power and giant databases. The Google and Facebook algorithms not only know exactly how you feel, they also know a million other things about you that you hardly suspect. Consequently you should now stop listening to your feelings, and start listening to these external algorithms instead. What’s the use of having democratic elections when the algorithms know how each person is going to vote, and when they also know the exact neurological reasons why one person votes Democrat while another votes Republican? Whereas humanism commanded: ‘Listen to your feelings!’ Dataism now commands: ‘Listen to the algorithms! They know how you feel.’ When you contemplate whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war, Dataism tells you it would be a total waste of time to climb a high mountain and watch the sun setting on the waves. It would be equally pointless to go to a museum, write a private diary or have a heart-to-heart talk with a friend. Yes, in order to make the right decisions you must get to know yourself better. But if you want to know yourself in the twenty-first century, there are much better methods than climbing mountains, going to museums or writing diaries. Here are some practical Dataist guidelines for you: ‘You want to know who you really are?’ asks Dataism. ‘Then forget about mountains and museums. Have you had your DNA sequenced? No?! What are you waiting for? Go and do it today. And convince your grandparents, parents and siblings to have their DNA sequenced too – their data is very valuable for you. And have you heard about these wearable biometric devices that measure your blood pressure and heart rate twenty-four hours a day? Good – so buy one of those, put it on and connect it to your smartphone. And while you are shopping, buy a mobile camera and microphone, record everything you do, and put in online. And allow Google and Facebook to read all your emails, monitor all your chats and messages, and keep a record of all your Likes and clicks. If you do all that, then the great algorithms of the Internet-of-All-Things will tell you whom to marry, which career to pursue and whether to start a war.’ But where do these great algorithms come from? This is the mystery of Dataism. Just as according to Christianity we humans cannot understand God and His plan, so Dataism says the human brain cannot embrace the new master algorithms. At present, of course, the algorithms are mostly written by human hackers. Yet the really important algorithms – such as the Google search algorithm – are developed by huge teams. Each member understands just one part of the puzzle, and nobody really understands the algorithm as a whole. Moreover, with the rise of machine learning and artificial neural networks, more and more algorithms evolve independently, improving themselves and learning from their own mistakes. They analyse astronomical amounts of data, which no human can possibly encompass, and learn to recognise patterns and adopt strategies that escape the human mind. The seed algorithm may initially be developed by humans, but as it grows, it follows its own path, going where no human has gone before – and where no human can follow.\n\nA Ripple in the Data Flow\n\nDataism naturally has its critics and heretics. As we saw in Chapter 3, it’s doubtful whether life can really be reduced to data flows. In particular, at present we have no idea how or why data flows could produce consciousness and subjective experiences. Maybe we’ll have a good explanation in twenty years. But maybe we’ll discover that organisms aren’t algorithms after all. It is equally doubtful whether life boils down to decision-making. Under Dataist influence, both the life sciences and the social sciences have become obsessed with decision-making processes, as if that’s all there is to life. But is it so? Sensations, emotions and thoughts certainly play an important part in making decisions, but is that their sole meaning? Dataism gains a better and better understanding of decision-making processes, but it might be adopting an increasingly skewed view of life. A critical examination of the Dataist dogma is likely to be not only the greatest scientific challenge of the twenty-first century, but also the most urgent political and economic project. Scholars in the life sciences and social sciences should ask themselves whether we miss anything when we understand life as data processing and decision-making. Is there perhaps something in the universe that cannot be reduced to data? Suppose non-conscious algorithms could eventually outperform conscious intelligence in all known data-processing tasks – what, if anything, would be lost by replacing conscious intelligence with superior non-conscious algorithms? Of course, even if Dataism is wrong and organisms aren’t just algorithms, it won’t necessarily prevent Dataism from taking over the world. Many previous religions gained enormous popularity and power despite their factual mistakes. If Christianity and communism could do it, why not Dataism? Dataism has especially good prospects, because it is currently spreading across all scientific disciplines. A unified scientific paradigm may easily become an unassailable dogma. It is very difficult to contest a scientific paradigm, but up till now, no single paradigm was adopted by the entire scientific establishment. Hence scholars in one field could always import heretical views from outside. But if everyone from musicologists to biologists uses the same Dataist paradigm, interdisciplinary excursions will serve only to strengthen the paradigm further. Consequently even if the paradigm is flawed, it would be extremely difficult to resist it. If Dataism succeeds in conquering the world, what will happen to us humans? In the beginning, it will probably accelerate the humanist pursuit of health, happiness and power. Dataism spreads itself by promising to fulfil these humanist aspirations. In order to gain immortality, bliss and divine powers of creation, we need to process immense amounts of data, far beyond the capacity of the human brain. So the algorithms will do it for us. Yet once authority shifts from humans to algorithms, the humanist projects may become irrelevant. Once we abandon the homo-centric world view in favour of a data-centric world view, human health and happiness may seem far less important. Why bother so much about obsolete data-processing machines when much better models are already in existence? We are striving to engineer the Internet-of-All-Things in the hope that it will make us healthy, happy and powerful. Yet once the Internet-of-All\u0002Things is up and running, we might be reduced from engineers to chips, then to data, and eventually we might dissolve within the data torrent like a clump of earth within a gushing river. Dataism thereby threatens to do to Homo sapiens what Homo sapiens has done to all other animals. In the course of history humans have created a global network, and evaluated everything according to its function within the network. For thousands of years, this boosted human pride and prejudices. Since humans fulfilled the most important functions in the network, it was easy for us to take credit for the network’s achievements, and to see ourselves as the apex of creation. The lives and experiences of all other animals were undervalued, because they fulfilled far less important functions, and whenever an animal ceased to fulfil any function at all, it went extinct. However, once humans lose their functional importance to the network, we will discover that we are not the apex of creation after all. The yardsticks that we ourselves have enshrined will condemn us to join the mammoths and the Chinese river dolphins in oblivion. Looking back, humanity will turn out to be just a ripple within the cosmic data flow. We cannot really predict the future. All the scenarios outlined in this book should be understood as possibilities rather than prophecies. When we think about the future, our horizons are usually constrained by present-day ideologies and social systems. Democracy encourages us to believe in a democratic future; capitalism doesn’t allow us to envisage a non-capitalist alternative; and humanism makes it difficult for us to imagine a post-human destiny. At most, we sometimes recycle past events and think about them as alternative futures. For example, twentieth\u0002century Nazism and communism serve as a blueprint for many dystopian fantasies; and science-fiction authors use medieval and ancient legacies to imagine Jedi knights and galactic emperors fighting it out with spaceships and laser guns. This book traces the origins of our present-day conditioning in order to loosen its grip and enable us to think in far more imaginative ways about our future. Instead of narrowing our horizons by forecasting a single definitive scenario, the book aims to broaden our horizons and make us aware of a much wider spectrum of options. As I have repeatedly emphasised, nobody really knows what the job market, the family or the ecology will look like in 2050, or what religions, economic systems or political structures will dominate the world. Yet broadening our horizons can backfire by making us more confused and inactive than before. With so many scenarios and possibilities, what should we pay attention to? The world is changing faster than ever before, and we are flooded by impossible amounts of data, of ideas, of promises and of threats. Humans relinquish authority to the free market, to crowd wisdom and to external algorithms partly because they cannot deal with the deluge of data. In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. People just don’t know what to pay attention to, and they often spend their time investigating and debating side issues. In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore. So of everything that happens in our chaotic world, what should we focus on? If we think in term of months, we had probably focus on immediate problems such as the turmoil in the Middle East, the refugee crisis in Europe and the slowing of the Chinese economy. If we think in terms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom large.\n\nYet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are overshadowed by three interlinked processes:\n\n1\\. Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing.\n\n2\\. Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.\n\n3\\. Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.\n\nThese three processes raise three key questions, which I hope will stick in your mind long after you have finished this book:\n\n1\\. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?\n\n2\\. What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness?\n\n3\\. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?\"",

        "body": "Dataism says that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing. 1 This may strike you as some eccentric fringe notion, but in fact it has already conquered most of the scientific establishment. Dataism was born from the explosive confluence of two scientific tidal waves. In the 150 years since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, the life sciences have come to see organisms as biochemical algorithms. Simultaneously, in the eight decades since Alan Turing formulated the idea of a Turing Machine, computer scientists have learned to engineer increasingly sophisticated electronic algorithms. Dataism puts the two together, pointing out that exactly the same mathematical laws apply to both biochemical and electronic algorithms. Dataism thereby collapses the barrier between animals and machines, and expects electronic algorithms to eventually decipher and outperform biochemical algorithms. For politicians, business people and ordinary consumers, Dataism offers groundbreaking technologies and immense new powers. For scholars and intellectuals it also promises to provide the scientific holy grail that has eluded us for centuries: a single overarching theory that unifies all the scientific disciplines from literature and musicology to economics and biology. According to Dataism, King Lear and the flu virus are just two patterns of data flow that can be analysed using the same basic concepts and tools. This idea is extremely attractive. It gives all scientists a common language, builds bridges over academic rifts and easily exports insights across disciplinary borders. Musicologists, political scientists and cell biologists can finally understand each other. In the process, Dataism inverts the traditional pyramid of learning. Hitherto, data was seen as only the first step in a long chain of intellectual activity. Humans were supposed to distil data into information, information into knowledge, and knowledge into wisdom. However, Dataists believe that humans can no longer cope with the immense flows of data, hence they cannot distil data into information, let alone into knowledge or wisdom. The work of processing data should therefore be entrusted to electronic algorithms, whose capacity far exceeds that of the human brain. In practice, this means that Dataists are sceptical about human knowledge and wisdom, and prefer to put their trust in Big Data and computer algorithms. Dataism is most firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines: computer science and biology. Of the two, biology is the more important. It was the biological embracement of Dataism that turned a limited breakthrough in computer science into a world-shattering cataclysm that may completely transform the very nature of life. You may not agree with the idea that organisms are algorithms, and that giraffes, tomatoes and human beings are just different methods for processing data. But you should know that this is current scientific dogma, and that it is changing our world beyond recognition. Not only individual organisms are seen today as data-processing systems, but also entire societies such as beehives, bacteria colonies, forests and human cities. Economists increasingly interpret the economy, too, as a data-processing system. Laypeople believe that the economy consists of peasants growing wheat, workers manufacturing clothes, and customers buying bread and underpants. Yet experts see the economy as a mechanism for gathering data about desires and abilities, and turning this data into decisions. According to this view, free-market capitalism and state-controlled communism aren’t competing ideologies, ethical creeds or political institutions. At bottom, they are competing data-processing systems. Capitalism uses distributed processing, whereas communism relies on centralised processing. Capitalism processes data by directly connecting all producers and consumers to one another, and allowing them to exchange information freely and make decisions independently. For example, how do you determine the price of bread in a free market? Well, every bakery may produce as much bread as it likes, and charge for it as much as it wants. The customers are equally free to buy as much bread as they can afford, or take their business to the competitor. It isn’t illegal to charge $1,000 for a baguette, but nobody is likely to buy it. On a much grander scale, if investors predict increased demand for bread, they will buy shares of biotech firms that genetically engineer more prolific wheat strains. The inflow of capital will enable the firms to speed up their research, thereby providing more wheat faster, and averting bread shortages. Even if one biotech giant adopts a flawed theory and reaches an impasse, its more successful competitors will achieve the hoped-for breakthrough. Free-market capitalism thus distributes the work of analysing data and making decisions between many independent but interconnected processors. As the Austrian economics guru Friedrich Hayek explained, ‘In a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people.’ 2 According to this view, the stock exchange is the fastest and most efficient data-processing system humankind has so far created. Everyone is welcome to join, if not directly then through their banks or pension funds. The stock exchange runs the global economy, and takes into account everything that happens all over the planet – and even beyond it. Prices are influenced by successful scientific experiments, by political scandals in Japan, by volcanic eruptions in Iceland and even by irregular activities on the surface of the sun. In order for the system to run smoothly, as much information as possible needs to flow as freely as possible. When millions of people throughout the world have access to all the relevant information, they determine the most accurate price of oil, of Hyundai shares and of Swedish government bonds by buying and selling them. It has been estimated that the stock exchange needs just fifteen minutes of trade to determine the influence of a New York Times headline on the prices of most shares. 3 Data-processing considerations also explain why capitalists favour lower taxes. Heavy taxation means that a large part of all available capital accumulates in one place – the state coffers – and consequently more and more decisions have to be made by a single processor, namely the government. This creates an overly centralised data-processing system. In extreme cases, when taxes are exceedingly high, almost all capital ends up in the government’s hands, and so the government alone calls the shots. It dictates the price of bread, the location of bakeries, and the research-and-development budget. In a free market, if one processor makes a wrong decision, others will be quick to utilise its mistake. However, when a single processor makes almost all the decisions, mistakes can be catastrophic. This extreme situation in which all data is processed and all decisions are made by a single central processor is called communism. In a communist economy, people allegedly work according to their abilities, and receive according to their needs. In other words, the government takes 100 per cent of your profits, decides what you need and then supplies these needs. Though no country ever realised this scheme in its extreme form, the Soviet Union and its satellites came as close as they could. They abandoned the principle of distributed data processing, and switched to a model of centralised data processing. All information from throughout the Soviet Union flowed to a single location in Moscow, where all the important decisions were made. Producers and consumers could not communicate directly, and had to obey government orders.\n\nFor instance, the Soviet economics ministry might decide that the price of bread in all shops should be exactly two roubles and four kopeks, that a particular kolkhoz in the Odessa oblast should switch from growing wheat to raising chickens, and that the Red October bakery in Moscow should produce 3.5 million loaves of bread per day, and not a single loaf more. Meanwhile the Soviet science ministry forced all Soviet biotech laboratories to adopt the theories of Trofim Lysenko – the infamous head of the Lenin Academy for Agricultural Sciences. Lysenko rejected the dominant genetic theories of his day. He insisted that if an organism acquired some new trait during its lifetime, this quality could pass directly to its descendants. This idea flew in the face of Darwinian orthodoxy, but it dovetailed nicely with communist educational principles. It implied that if you could train wheat plants to withstand cold weather, their progenies will also be cold-resistant. Lysenko accordingly sent billions of counter-revolutionary wheat plants to be re-educated in Siberia – and the Soviet Union was soon forced to import more and more flour from the United States.\n\nCapitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological changes. The central committee of the Communist Party just could not deal with the rapidly changing world of the late twentieth century. When all data is accumulated in one secret bunker, and all important decisions are taken by a group of elderly apparatchiks, you can produce nuclear bombs by the cartload, but you won’t get an Apple or a Wikipedia. There is a story (probably apocryphal, like most good stories) that when Mikhail Gorbachev tried to resuscitate the moribund Soviet economy, he sent one of his chief aids to London to find out what Thatcherism was all about, and how a capitalist system actually functioned. The hosts took their Soviet visitor on a tour of the City, of the London stock exchange and of the London School of Economics, where he had lengthy talks with bank managers, entrepreneurs and professors. After a few hours, the Soviet expert burst out: ‘Just one moment, please. Forget about all these complicated economic theories. We have been going back and forth across London for a whole day now, and there’s one thing I cannot understand. Back in Moscow, our finest minds are working on the bread supply system, and yet there are such long queues in every bakery and grocery store. Here in London live millions of people, and we have passed today in front of many shops and supermarkets, yet I haven’t seen a single bread queue. Please take me to meet the person in charge of supplying bread to London. I must learn his secret.’ The hosts scratched their heads, thought for a moment, and said: ‘Nobody is in charge of supplying bread to London.’ That’s the capitalist secret of success. No central processing unit monopolises all the data on the London bread supply. The information flows freely between millions of consumers and producers, bakers and tycoons, farmers and scientists. Market forces determine the price of bread, the number of loaves baked each day and the research-and-development priorities. If market forces make the wrong decision, they soon correct themselves, or so capitalists believe. For our current purposes, it doesn’t matter whether the theory is correct. The crucial thing is that the theory understands economics in terms of data processing.\n\nWhere Has All the Power Gone?\n\nPolitical scientists also increasingly interpret human political structures as data\u0002processing systems. Like capitalism and communism, so democracies and dictatorships are in essence competing mechanisms for gathering and analysing information. Dictatorships use centralised processing methods, whereas democracies prefer distributed processing. In the last decades democracy gained the upper hand because under the unique conditions of the late twentieth century, distributed processing worked better. Under alternative conditions – those prevailing in the ancient Roman Empire, for instance – centralised processing had an edge, which is why the Roman Republic fell and power shifted from the Senate and popular assemblies into the hands of a single autocratic emperor. This implies that as data-processing conditions change again in the twenty\u0002first century, democracy might decline and even disappear. As both the volume and speed of data increase, venerable institutions like elections, parties and parliaments might become obsolete – not because they are unethical, but because they don’t process data efficiently enough. These institutions evolved in an era when politics moved faster than technology. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Industrial Revolution unfolded slowly enough for politicians and voters to remain one step ahead of it and regulate and manipulate its course. Yet whereas the rhythm of politics has not changed much since the days of steam, technology has switched from first gear to fourth. Technological revolutions now outpace political processes, causing MPs and voters alike to lose control. The rise of the Internet gives us a taste of things to come. Cyberspace is now crucial to our daily lives, our economy and our security. Yet the critical choices between alternative web designs weren’t taken through a democratic political process, even though they involved traditional political issues such as sovereignty, borders, privacy and security. Did you ever vote about the shape of cyberspace? Decisions made by web designers far from the public limelight mean that today the Internet is a free and lawless zone that erodes state sovereignty, ignores borders, abolishes privacy and poses perhaps the most formidable global security risk. Whereas a decade ago it hardly registered on the radar, today hysterical officials are predicting an imminent cyber 9/11. Governments and NGOs consequently conduct intense debates about restructuring the Internet, but it is much harder to change an existing system than to intervene at its inception. Besides, by the time the cumbersome government bureaucracy makes up its mind about cyber regulation, the Internet has morphed ten times. The governmental tortoise cannot keep up with the technological hare. It is overwhelmed by data. The NSA may be spying on your every word, but to judge by the repeated failures of American foreign policy, nobody in Washington knows what to do with all the data. Never in history did a government know so much about what’s going on in the world – yet few empires have botched things up as clumsily as the contemporary United States. It’s like a poker player who knows what cards his opponents hold, yet somehow still manages to lose round after round. In the coming decades, it is likely that we will see more Internet-like revolutions, in which technology steals a march on politics. Artificial intelligence and biotechnology might soon overhaul our societies and economies – and our bodies and minds too – but they are hardly a blip on our political radar. Our current democratic structures just cannot collect and process the relevant data fast enough, and most voters don’t understand biology and cybernetics well enough to form any pertinent opinions. Hence traditional democratic politics loses control of events, and fails to provide us with meaningful visions for the future. That doesn’t mean we will go back to twentieth-century-style dictatorships. Authoritarian regimes seem to be equally overwhelmed by the pace of technological development and the speed and volume of the data flow. In the twentieth century, dictators had grand visions for the future. Communists and fascists alike sought to completely destroy the old world and build a new world in its place. Whatever you think about Lenin, Hitler or Mao, you cannot accuse them of lacking vision. Today it seems that leaders have a chance to pursue even grander visions. While communists and Nazis tried to create a new society and a new human with the help of steam engines and typewriters, today’s prophets could rely on biotechnology and super-computers. In science-fiction films, ruthless Hitler-like politicians are quick to pounce on such new technologies, putting them in the service of this or that megalomaniac political ideal. Yet flesh-and-blood politicians in the early twenty-first century, even in authoritarian countries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, are nothing like their Hollywood counterparts. They don’t seem to plot any Brave New World. The wildest dreams of Kim Jong-un and Ali Khamenei don’t go much beyond atom bombs and ballistic missiles: that is so 1945. Putin’s aspirations seem confined to rebuilding the old Soviet zone, or the even older tsarist empire. Meanwhile in the USA, paranoid Republicans accuse Barack Obama of being a ruthless despot hatching conspiracies to destroy the foundations of American society – yet in eight years of presidency he barely managed to pass a minor health-care reform. Creating new worlds and new humans is far beyond his agenda. Precisely because technology is now moving so fast, and parliaments and dictators alike are overwhelmed by data they cannot process quickly enough, present-day politicians are thinking on a far smaller scale than their predecessors a century ago. In the early twenty-first century, politics is consequently bereft of grand visions. Government has become mere administration. It manages the country, but it no longer leads it. It makes sure teachers are paid on time and sewage systems don’t overflow, but it has no idea where the country will be in twenty years. To some extent, this is a very good thing. Given that some of the big political visions of the twentieth century led us to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and the Great Leap Forward, maybe we are better off in the hands of petty-minded bureaucrats. Mixing godlike technology with megalomaniac politics is a recipe for disaster. Many neo-liberal economists and political scientists argue that it is best to leave all the important decisions in the hands of the free market. They thereby give politicians the perfect excuse for inaction and ignorance, which are reinterpreted as profound wisdom. Politicians find it convenient to believe that the reason they don’t understand the world is that they need not understand it. Yet mixing godlike technology with myopic politics also has its downside. Lack of vision isn’t always a blessing, and not all visions are necessarily bad. In the twentieth century, the dystopian Nazi vision did not fall apart spontaneously. It was defeated by the equally grand visions of socialism and liberalism. It is dangerous to trust our future to market forces, because these forces do what’s good for the market rather than what’s good for humankind or for the world. The hand of the market is blind as well as invisible, and left to its own devices it may fail to do anything about the threat of global warming or the dangerous potential of artificial intelligence. Some people believe that there is somebody in charge after all. Not democratic politicians or autocratic despots, but rather a small coterie of billionaires who secretly run the world. But such conspiracy theories never work, because they underestimate the complexity of the system. A few billionaires smoking cigars and drinking Scotch in some back room cannot possibly understand everything happening on the globe, let alone control it. Ruthless billionaires and small interest groups flourish in today’s chaotic world not because they read the map better than anyone else, but because they have very narrow aims. In a chaotic system, tunnel vision has its advantages, and the billionaires’ power is strictly proportional to their goals. If the world’s richest man would like to make another billion dollars he could easily game the system in order to achieve his goal. In contrast, if he would like to reduce global inequality or stop global warming, even he won’t be able to do it, because the system is far too complex. Yet power vacuums seldom last long. If in the twenty-first century traditional political structures can no longer process the data fast enough to produce meaningful visions, then new and more efficient structures will evolve to take their place. These new structures may be very different from any previous political institutions, whether democratic or authoritarian. The only question is who will build and control these structures. If humankind is no longer up to the task, perhaps it might give somebody else a try.\"",

        "body": "History in a Nutshell\n\nFrom a Dataist perspective, we may interpret the entire human species as a single data-processing system, with individual humans serving as its chips. If so, we can also understand the whole of history as a process of improving the efficiency of this system, through four basic methods:\n\n1\\. Increasing the number of processors. A city of 100,000 people has more computing power than a village of 1,000 people.\n\n2\\. Increasing the variety of processors. Different processors may use diverse ways to calculate and analyse data. Using several kinds of processors in a single system may therefore increase its dynamism and creativity. A conversation between a peasant, a priest and a physician may produce novel ideas that would never emerge from a conversation between three hunter-gatherers.\n\n3\\. Increasing the number of connections between processors. There is little point in increasing the mere number and variety of processors if they are poorly connected to each other. A trade network linking ten cities is likely to result in many more economic, technological and social innovations than ten isolated cities.\n\n4\\. Increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. Connecting processors is hardly useful if data cannot flow freely. Just building roads between ten cities won’t be very useful if they are plagued by robbers, or if some autocratic despot doesn’t allow merchants and travellers to move as they wish.\n\nThese four methods often contradict one another. The greater the number and variety of processors, the harder it is to freely connect them. The construction of the Sapiens data-processing system accordingly passed through four main stages, each characterised by an emphasis on different methods. The first stage began with the Cognitive Revolution, which made it possible to connect unlimited numbers of Sapiens into a single data-processing network. This gave Sapiens a crucial advantage over all other human and animal species. While there is a strict limit to the number of Neanderthals, chimpanzees or elephants you can connect to the same net, there is no limit to the number of Sapiens. Sapiens used their advantage in data processing to overrun the entire world. However, as they spread into different lands and climates they lost touch with one another, and underwent diverse cultural transformations. The result was an immense variety of human cultures, each with its own lifestyle, behaviour patterns and world view. Hence the first phase of history involved an increase in the number and variety of human processors, at the expense of connectivity: 20,000 years ago there were many more Sapiens than 70,000 years ago, and Sapiens in Europe processed information differently to Sapiens in China. However, there were no connections between people in Europe and China, and it would have seemed utterly impossible that all Sapiens may one day be part of a single data-processing web. The second stage began with the Agricultural Revolution and continued until the invention of writing and money about 5,000 years ago. Agriculture speeded demographic growth, so the number of human processors rose sharply. Simultaneously, agriculture enabled many more people to live together in the same place, thereby generating dense local networks that contained an unprecedented number of processors. In addition, agriculture created new incentives and opportunities for different networks to trade and communicate with one another. Nevertheless, during the second phase centrifugal forces remained predominant. In the absence of writing and money, humans could not establish cities, kingdoms or empires. Humankind was still divided into innumerable little tribes, each with its own lifestyle and world view. Uniting the whole of humankind was not even a fantasy. The third stage kicked off with the invention of writing and money about 5,000 years ago, and lasted until the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Thanks to writing and money, the gravitational field of human cooperation finally overpowered the centrifugal forces. Human groups bonded and merged to form cities and kingdoms. Political and commercial links between different cities and kingdoms also tightened. At least since the first millennium BC – when coinage, empires and universal religions appeared – humans began to consciously dream about forging a single network that would encompass the entire globe. This dream became a reality during the fourth and last stage of history, which began around 1492. Early modern explorers, conquerors and traders wove the first thin threads that encompassed the whole world. In the late modern period these threads were made stronger and denser, so that the spider’s web of Columbus’s days became the steel and asphalt grid of the twenty-first century. Even more importantly, information was allowed to flow increasingly freely along this global grid. When Columbus first hooked up the Eurasian net to the American net, only a few bits of data could cross the ocean each year, running the gauntlet of cultural prejudices, strict censorship and political repression. But as the years went by, the free market, the scientific community, the rule of law and the spread of democracy all helped to lift the barriers. We often imagine that democracy and the free market won because they were ‘good’. In truth, they won because they improved the global data-processing system. So over the last 70,000 years humankind first spread out, then separated into distinct groups, and finally merged again. Yet the process of unification did not take us back to the beginning. When the different human groups fused into the global village of today, each brought along its unique legacy of thoughts, tools and behaviours, which it collected and developed along the way. Our modern larders are now stuffed with Middle Eastern wheat, Andean potatoes, New Guinean sugar and Ethiopian coffee. Similarly, our language, religion, music and politics are replete with heirlooms from across the planet. 5 If humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, what is its output? Dataists would say that its output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.\n\nInformation Wants to be Free\n\nLike capitalism, Dataism too began as a neutral scientific theory, but is now mutating into a religion that claims to determine right and wrong. The supreme value of this new religion is ‘information flow’. If life is the movement of information, and if we think that life is good, it follows that we should extend, deepen and spread the flow of information in the universe. According to Dataism, human experiences are not sacred and Homo sapiens isn’t the apex of creation or a precursor of some future Homo deus. Humans are merely tools for creating the Internet-of-All-Things, which may eventually spread out from planet Earth to cover the whole galaxy and even the whole universe. This cosmic data- processing system would be like God. It will be everywhere and will control everything, and humans are destined to merge into it. This vision is reminiscent of some traditional religious visions. Thus Hindus believe that humans can and should merge into the universal soul of the cosmos – the atman. Christians believe that after death saints are filled by the infinite grace of God, whereas sinners cut themselves off from His presence. Indeed, in Silicon Valley the Dataist prophets consciously use traditional messianic language. For example, Ray Kurzweil’s book of prophecies is called The Singularity is Near, echoing John the Baptist’s cry: ‘the kingdom of heaven is near’ (Matthew 3:2). Dataists explain to those who still worship flesh-and-blood mortals that they are overly attached to outdated technology. Homo sapiens is an obsolete algorithm. After all, what’s the advantage of humans over chickens? Only that in humans information flows in much more complex patterns than in chickens. Humans absorb more data, and process it using better algorithms. (In day-to\u0002day language that means that humans allegedly have deeper emotions and superior intellectual abilities. But remember that according to current biological dogma, emotions and intelligence are just algorithms.) Well then, if we could create a data-processing system that absorbs even more data than a human being, and that processes it even more efficiently, wouldn’t that system be superior to a human in exactly the same way that a human is superior to a chicken? Dataism isn’t limited to idle prophecies. Like every religion, it has its practical commandments. First and foremost, a Dataist ought to maximise data flow by connecting to more and more media, and producing and consuming more and more information. Like other successful religions, Dataism is also missionary. Its second commandment is to connect everything to the system, including heretics who don’t want to be connected. And ‘everything’ means more than just humans. It means every thing. My body, of course, but also the cars on the street, the refrigerators in the kitchen, the chickens in their coop and the trees in the jungle – all should be connected to the Internet-of-All-Things. The refrigerator will monitor the number of eggs in the drawer, and inform the chicken coop when a new shipment is needed. The cars will talk with one another, and the trees in the jungle will report on the weather and on carbon dioxide levels. We mustn’t leave any part of the universe disconnected from the great web of life. Conversely, the greatest sin is to block the data flow. What is death, if not a situation when information doesn’t flow? Hence Dataism upholds the freedom of information as the greatest good of all. People rarely manage to come up with a completely new value. The last time this happened was in the eighteenth century, when the humanist revolution preached the stirring ideals of human liberty, human equality and human fraternity. Since 1789, despite numerous wars, revolutions and upheavals, humans have not managed to come up with any new value. All subsequent conflicts and struggles have been conducted either in the name of the three humanist values, or in the name of even older values such as obeying God or serving the nation. Dataism is the first movement since 1789 that created a really novel value: freedom of information. We mustn’t confuse freedom of information with the old liberal ideal of freedom of expression. Freedom of expression was given to humans, and protected their right to think and say what they wished – including their right to keep their mouths shut and their thoughts to themselves. Freedom of information, in contrast, is not given to humans. It is given to information. Moreover, this novel value may impinge on the traditional freedom of expression, by privileging the right of information to circulate freely over the right of humans to own data and to restrict its movement. On 11 January 2013, Dataism got its first martyr when Aaron Swartz, a twenty-six-year-old American hacker, committed suicide in his apartment. Swartz was a rare genius. At fourteen, he helped develop the crucial RSS protocol. Swartz was also a firm believer in the freedom of information. In 2008 he published the ‘Guerilla Open Access Manifesto’ that demanded a free and unlimited flow of information. Swartz said that ‘We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.’ Swartz was as good as his word. He became annoyed with the JSTOR digital library for charging its customers. JSTOR holds millions of scientific papers and studies, and believes in the freedom of expression of scientists and journal editors, which includes the freedom to charge a fee for reading their articles. According to JSTOR, if I want to get paid for the ideas I created, it’s my right to do so. Swartz thought otherwise. He believed that information wants to be free, that ideas don’t belong to the people who created them, and that it is wrong to lock data behind walls and charge money for entrance. He used the MIT computer network to access JSTOR, and downloaded hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, which he intended to release onto the Internet, so that everybody could read them freely. Swartz was arrested and put on trial. When he realised he would probably be convicted and sent to jail, he hanged himself. Hackers reacted with petitions and attacks directed at the academic and governmental institutions that persecuted Swartz and that infringe on the freedom of information. Under pressure, JSTOR apologised for its part in the tragedy, and today allows free access to much of its data (though not to all of it). 6 To convince sceptics, Dataist missionaries repeatedly explain the immense benefits of the freedom of information. Just as capitalists believe that all good things depend on economic growth, so Dataists believe all good things – including economic growth – depend on the freedom of information. Why did the USA grow faster than the USSR? Because information flowed more freely in the USA. Why are Americans healthier, wealthier and happier than Iranians or Nigerians? Thanks to the freedom of information. So if we want to create a better world, the key is to set the data free. We have already seen that Google can detect new epidemics faster than traditional health organisations, but only if we allow it free access to the information we are producing. A free data flow can similarly reduce pollution and waste, for example by rationalising the transportation system. In 2010 the number of private cars in the world exceeded 1 billion, and it has since kept growing. 7 These cars pollute the planet and waste enormous resources, not least by necessitating ever wider roads and parking spaces. People have become so used to the convenience of private transport that they are unlikely to settle for buses and trains. However, Dataists point out that people really want mobility rather than a private car, and a good data-processing system can provide this mobility far more cheaply and efficiently. I have a private car, but most of the time it sits idly in the car park. On a typical day, I enter my car at 8:04, and drive for half an hour to the university, where I park my car for the day. At 18:11 I come back to the car, drive half an hour back home, and that’s it. So I am using my car for just an hour a day. Why do I need to keep it for the other twenty-three hours? We can create a smart car\u0002pool system, run by computer algorithms. The computer would know that I need to leave home at 8:04, and would route the nearest autonomous car to pick me up at that precise moment. After dropping me off at campus, it would be available for other uses instead of waiting in the car park. At 18:11 sharp, as I leave the university gate, another communal car would stop right in front of me, and take me home. In such a way, 50 million communal autonomous cars may replace 1 billion private cars, and we would also need far fewer roads, bridges, tunnels and parking spaces. Provided, of course, I renounce my privacy and allow the algorithms to always know where I am and where I want to go.\"",

They posited that the market had as many as eight underlying “states”—such as “high variance,” when stocks experienced larger-than-average moves, and “good,” when shares generally rose. Here’s what was really unique: The paper didn’t try to identify or predict these states using economic theory or other conventional methods, nor did the researchers seek to address why the market entered certain states. Simons and his colleagues used mathematics to determine the set of states best fitting the observed pricing data; their model then made its bets accordingly. The whys didn’t matter, Simons and his colleagues seemed to suggest, just the strategies to take advantage of the inferred states. For the majority of investors, this was an unheard-of approach, but gamblers would have understood it well. Poker players surmise the mood of their opponents by judging their behavior and adjusting their strategies accordingly. Facing off against someone in a miserable mood calls for certain tactics; others are optimal if a competitor seems overjoyed and overconfident. Players don’t need to know why their opponent is glum or exuberant to profit from those moods; they just have to identify the moods themselves. Simons and the code-breakers proposed a similar approach to predicting stock prices, relying on a sophisticated mathematical tool called a hidden Markov model. Just as a gambler might guess an opponent’s mood based on his or her decisions, an investor might deduce a market’s state from its price movements\"",

To improve their predictive models, Ax concluded it was time to bring in someone with experience developing stochastic equations, the broader family of equations to which Markov chains belong. Stochastic equations model dynamic processes that evolve over time and can involve a high level of uncertainty. Straus had recently read academic literature suggesting that trading models based on stochastic equations could be valuable tools.\n\nThese equations can make predictions using data that appears random; weather-forecasting models, for example, use stochastic equations to generate reasonably accurate estimates. Members of Axcom’s team viewed investing through a math prism and understood financial markets to be complicated and evolving, with behavior that is difficult to predict, at least over long stretches—just like a stochastic process. It’s easy to see why they saw similarities between stochastic processes and investing. For one thing, Simons, Ax, and Straus didn’t believe the market was truly a “random walk,” or entirely unpredictable, as some academics and others argued. Though it clearly had elements of randomness, much like the weather, mathematicians like Simons and Ax would argue that a probability distribution could capture futures prices as well as any other stochastic process.\n\n“The goal was to invent a mathematical model and use it as a framework to infer some consequences and conclusions,” Carmona says. “The name of the game is not to always be right, but to be right often enough.” \"",

In truth, there likely are fewer inefficiencies and opportunities for investors than generally presumed. For all the unique data, computer firepower, special talent, and trading and risk-management expertise Renaissance has gathered, the firm only profits on barely more than 50 percent of its trades, a sign of how challenging it is to try to beat the market—and how foolish it is for most investors to try.\n\nSimons and his colleagues generally avoid predicting pure stock moves.

        "title": "\"Index funds now account for more than 40 percent of the total invested in mutual funds and ETFs. So active managers responded with a new criticism. It is now alleged that index funds pose a grave danger both to the stock market and to the general economy    ",
        "body": "One of the most respected research houses on Wall Street, Sanford C. Bernstein, published a 47-page report in 2016 with the provocative title, The Silent Road to Serfdom: Why Passive Investing is Worse than Marxism. The report argued that a capitalist market system in which investors invest passively in index funds is even worse than a centrally planned economy, where government directs all capital investment. Indexing is alleged to cause money to pour into a set of investments independent of considerations such as profitability and growth opportunities. It is active managers who ensure that new information is properly reflected in stock prices. Indexing is also accused of producing a concentration of ownership not seen since the days of the Rockefeller Trust. Could it be possible that if everyone invested only in index funds, indexing could grow in the future to such a size that stocks could become massively mispriced? If everybody indexed, who would ensure that stock prices reflect all the information available about the prospects for different companies? Who would trade from stock to stock to ensure that the market was efficient? The paradox of index investing is that the stock market needs some active traders who analyze and act on new information so that stocks are efficiently priced and sufficiently liquid for investors to be able to buy and sell. Active traders play a positive role in determining security prices and how capital is allocated. This is the main logical pillar on which the efficient-market theory rests. If the spread of news is unimpeded, prices will react quickly so that they reflect all that is known. The paradox is that the very activity of active investors makes it highly unlikely that unexploited opportunities for abnormal profits can continue to exist. I have recounted the story of the finance professor and his students who spotted a $100 bill lying on the street. “If it was really a $100 bill,” the professor reasoned out loud, “someone would have already picked it up.” Fortunately, the students were skeptical, not only of Wall Street professionals but also of learned professors, and so they picked up the money. Clearly, there is considerable logic to the finance professor’s position. In markets where intelligent people are searching for value, it is unlikely that people will perpetually leave $100 bills around ready for the taking. But history tells us that unexploited opportunities do exist from time to time, as do periods of speculative excess pricing. We know of Dutchmen paying astronomical prices for tulip bulbs, of Englishmen splurging on the most improbable bubbles, and of modern institutional fund managers who convinced themselves that some Internet stocks were so unlike any other that any price was reasonable. And when investors were overcome with pessimism, real fundamental investment opportunities such as closed-end funds were passed by. Yet eventually, excessive valuations were corrected and investors did snatch up the bargain closed-end funds. Perhaps the finance professor’s advice should have been, “You had better pick up that $100 bill quickly because if it’s really there, someone else will surely take it.”\n\nActive managers are incentivized to perform this function by charging substantial management fees. They will continue to market their services with the claim that they have above-average insights that enable them to beat the market even though, unlike in Garrison Keillor’s mythical Lake Wobegon, they cannot all achieve above-average market returns. And even if the proportion of active managers shrinks to as little as 10 or 5 percent of the total, there would still be more than enough of them to make prices reflect information. We have far too much active management today, not too little. But as a thought experiment, suppose everybody did index and individual stocks did not reflect new information? Suppose a drug company develops a new cancer drug that promises to double the company’s sales and earnings, but the price of its shares does not increase to reflect the news. In our capitalist system it is inconceivable that some trader or hedge fund would not emerge to bid up the price of the stock and profit from the mispricing. In a free-market system we can expect that advantageous arbitrage opportunities are exploited by profit-seeking market participants no matter how many investors index. The facts indicate that the percentage of active managers outperformed by the index has increased over time. If anything, the stock market is becoming more efficient—not less so—despite the growth of indexing.\n\nTo be sure, index investors are free riders. They do receive the benefits that result from active trading without bearing the costs. But free riding on price signals provided by others is hardly a flaw of the capitalist system; it is an essential feature of that system. In a free-market economy we all benefit from relying on a set of market prices that are determined by others.\n\nIt is true that as indexing continues to grow, there may well be a growing concentration of ownership among the index-providers, and they will have increased influence in proxy voting. They must use their votes to ensure that companies act in the best interests of shareholders. In my own experience as a longtime director of Vanguard Group—the pioneers and leaders of the index fund revolution, with over $5 trillion under management—there was never an instance where a vote was made that would encourage anticompetitive behavior. I know of no examples where index funds have used their votes to collude in an attempt to cartelize any industry. There is simply no evidence that anticompetitive practices have actually been encouraged by giants such as Blackstone, Vanguard, and State Street because of their common ownership of all the major companies in an industry. Nor would it be in their interest to do so. The same investment companies control a sizeable portion of the common stock of every major company in the market. Perhaps banding together to encourage the airline companies to raise their prices would benefit their holdings of airline stocks. But this would mean higher costs for all the other companies in their portfolio that depend on the airlines to facilitate business travel. Index funds have no incentive to favor one industry over another. Indeed, since index funds have encouraged managements to adopt compensation systems based on relative rather than absolute performance, they have explicitly promoted vigorous competition among the firms in every industry. Index funds have been of enormous benefit for individual investors. Competition has driven the cost of broad-based index funds essentially to zero. Individuals can now save for retirement far more efficiently than before. Indexing has transformed the investing experience of millions of investors. It has helped them save for retirement and meet their other investment goals by providing efficient instruments that can be used to build diversified portfolios.\"",

        "body": "A personal experience I had a few years ago gave me firsthand evidence of just how well this compliance technique works. I was walking down the street when I was approached by an elevenor twelve-year-old boy. He introduced himself and said that he was selling tickets to the annual Boy Scouts circus to be held on the upcoming Saturday night. He asked if I wished to buy any at five dollars apiece. Since one of the last places I wanted to spend Saturday evening was with the Boy Scouts, I declined. “Well,” he said, “if you don’t want to buy any tickets, how about buying some of our big chocolate bars? They’re only a dollar each.” I bought a couple and, right away, realized that something noteworthy had happened. I knew that to be the case because: (a) I do not like chocolate bars; (b) I do like dollars; (c) I was standing there with two of his chocolate bars; and (d) he was walking away with two of my dollars.\n\nTo try to understand precisely what had happened, I went to my office and called a meeting of my research assistants. In discussing the situation, we began to see how the reciprocity rule was implicated in my compliance with the request to buy the candy bars. The general rule says that a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a similar return action. We have already seen that one consequence of the rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received. Another consequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us. As my research group thought about it, we realized that was exactly the position the Boy Scout had put me in. His request that I purchase some one-dollar chocolate bars had been put in the form of a concession on his part; it was presented as a retreat from his request that I buy some five-dollar tickets. If I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to be a concession on my part. As we have seen, there was such a concession: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered.\n\nIt was a classic example of how a weapon of automatic influence can infuse a compliance request with its power. \"",

In each case, there was a common thread in the accompanying message. The goods that were enclosed were to be considered a gift from the organization; and any money I wished to send should not be regarded as payment but rather as a return offering. As the letter from one of the missionary programs stated, the packet of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be directly paid for, but was designed “to encourage your kindness.” If we look past the obvious tax advantage, we can see a reason why it would be beneficial for the organization to have the cards viewed as a gift instead of merchandise: There is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even an unwanted one; but there is no such pressure to purchase an unwanted commercial product.\"",

The Krishna solicitor steps in front of him and hands him a flower. The man, reacting with surprise, takes it.7 Almost immediately, he tries to give it back, saying that he does not want the flower. The Krishna member responds that it is a gift from the Krishna Society and that it is the man’s to keep…however, a donation to further the Society’s good works would be appreciated. Again the target protests, “I don’t want this flower. Here, take it.” And again the solicitor refuses, “It’s our gift to you, sir.” There is visible conflict on the businessman’s face. Should he keep the flower and walk away without giving anything in return, or should he yield to the pressure of the deeply ingrained reciprocity rule and provide a contribution? By now, the conflict has spread from his face to his posture. He leans away from his benefactor, seemingly about to break free, only to be drawn back again by the pull of the rule. Once more his body tilts away, but it’s no use; he cannot disengage. With a nod of resignation, he fishes in his pocket and comes up with a dollar or two that is graciously accepted.

Common sense might suggest the reverse: If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he may be reluctant to spend very much more on the purchase of a sweater. But the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with what the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at the idea of spending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95 sweater does not seem excessive. The same principle applies to a man who wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes, belt) to go along with his new suit. Contrary to the commonsense view, the evidence supports the contrast-principle prediction. As sales motivation analysts Whitney, Hubin, and Murphy state, “The interesting thing is that even when a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before.” It is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first, not only because to fail to do so will lose the influence of the contrast principle; to fail to do so will also cause the principle to work actively against them. Presenting an inexpensive product first and following it with an expensive one will cause the expensive item to seem even more costly as a result—hardly a desirable consequence for most sales organizations.\"",

Langer demonstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting in line to use a library copying machine: Excuse me, I have five pages.

Compare this success rate to the results when she made the request only: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine? Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those asked complied. At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference between the two requests was the additional information provided by the words “because I’m in a rush.” But a third type of request tried by Langer showed that this was not the case. It seems that it was not the whole series of words, but the first one, “because,” that made the difference. Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer’s third type of request used the word “because” and then, adding nothing new, merely restated the obvious: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies? The result was that once again nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no new information, was added to justify their compliance. Just as the “cheep-cheep” sound of turkey chicks triggered an automatic mothering response from maternal turkeys—even when it emanated from a stuffed polecat—so, too, did the word “because” trigger an automatic compliance response from Langer’s subjects, even when they were given no subsequent reason to comply.\"",

There seems to be a click, whirr response to attractive people. Like all click, whirr reactions, it happens automatically, without forethought. The response itself falls into a category that social scientists call “halo effects.” A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others. And the evidence is now clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic.",
        "body": "Research has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking individuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence. Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. Certain of the consequences of this unconscious assumption that “good-looking equals good” scare me. For example, a study of the Canadian federal elections found that attractive candidates received more than two and a half times as many votes as unattractive candidates.1 Despite such evidence of favoritism toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demonstrated that voters do not realize their bias. In fact, 73 percent of Canadian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their votes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent even allowed for the possibility of such influence. A similar effect has been found in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants in a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable hiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the interviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices.\n\nEqually unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone structure. Good-looking people are likely to receive highly favorable treatment in the legal system. For example, in a Pennsylvania study, researchers rated the physical attractiveness of seventy-four separate male defendants at the start of their criminal trials. When, much later, the researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they found that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sentences. In fact, the attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid jail as the unattractive ones.3 In another study—this one on the damages awarded in a staged negligence trial—a defendant who was better looking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but when the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average compensation was $10,051. What’s more, both male and female jurors exhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism.\n\nIt is hardly any wonder, then, that the halo of physical attractiveness is regularly exploited by compliance professionals. Because we like attractive people and because we tend to comply with those we like, it makes sense that sales training programs include grooming hints, that fashionable clothiers select their floor staffs from among the good looking candidates, and that con men are handsome and con women pretty.\"",

        "body": "A young robbery suspect, let’s say, who has been advised of his rights and is maintaining his innocence, is brought to a room to be questioned by a pair of officers. One of the officers, either because the part suits him or because it is merely his turn, plays the role of Bad Cop. Before the suspect even sits down, Bad Cop curses “the son of a bitch” for the robbery. For the rest of the session his words come only with snarls and growls. He kicks the prisoner’s chair to emphasize his points. When he looks at the man, he seems to see a mound of garbage. If the suspect challenges Bad Cop’s accusations or just refuses to answer them, Bad Cop becomes livid. His rage soars. He swears he will do everything possible to assure a maximum sentence. He says he has friends in the district attorney’s office who will hear from him of the suspect’s noncooperative attitude and who will prosecute the case hard.\nAt the outset of Bad Cop’s performance, his partner, Good Cop, sits in the background. Then, slowly, he starts to chip in. First he speaks only to Bad Cop, trying to temper the burgeoning anger. “Calm down, Frank, calm down.” But Bad Cop shouts back, “Don’t tell me to calm down when he’s lying right to my face! I hate these lying bastards!” A bit later, Good Cop actually says something in the suspect’s behalf. “Take it easy, Frank, he’s only a kid.” Not much in the way of support, but compared to the rantings of Bad Cop, the words fall like music on the prisoner’s ears. Still, Bad Cop is unconvinced. “Kid? He’s no kid. He’s a punk. That’s what he is, a punk. And I’ll tell you something else. He’s over eighteen, and that’s all I need to get his ass sent so far behind bars they’ll need a flashlight to find him.”\nNow Good Cop begins to speak directly to the young man, calling him by his first name and pointing out any positive details of the case. “I’ll tell you, Kenny, you’re lucky that nobody was hurt and you weren’t armed. When you come up for sentencing, that’ll look good.” If the suspect persists in claiming innocence, Bad Cop launches into another tirade of curses and threats. But this time Good Cop stops him, “Okay, Frank,” handing Bad Cop some money, “I think we could all use some coffee. How about getting us three cups?” When Bad Cop is gone, it’s time for Good Cop’s big scene: “Look, man, I don’t know why, but my partner doesn’t like you, and he’s gonna try to get you. And he’s gonna be able to do it because we’ve got enough evidence right now. And he’s right about the D.A.’s office going hard on guys who don’t cooperate. You’re looking at five years, man, five years! Now, I don’t want to see that happen to you. So if you admit you robbed that place right now, before he gets back, I’ll take charge of your case and put in a good word for you to the D.A. If we work together on this, we can cut that five years down to two, maybe one. Do us both a favor, Kenny. Just tell me how you did it, and then let’s start working on getting you through this.” A full confession frequently follows.\nGood Cop/Bad Cop works as well as it does for several reasons: The fear of long incarceration is quickly instilled by Bad Cop’s threats; the perceptual contrast principle ensures that compared to the raving, venomous Bad Cop, the interrogator playing Good Cop will seem like an especially reasonable and kind man; and because Good Cop has intervened repeatedly on the suspect’s behalf—has even spent his own money for a cup of coffee—the reciprocity rule pressures for a return favor. The big reason that the technique is effective, though, is that it gives the suspect the idea that there is someone on his side, someone with his welfare in mind, someone working together with him, for him. In most situations, such a person would be viewed very favorably, but in the deep trouble our robbery suspect finds himself, that person takes on the character of a savior. And from savior, it is but a short step to trusted father confessor.\"",

Of course, the only way for this to work is to spread out all those harmless little chunks over a longer period of time. Hence the two weeks.\n\nThe first week, just put in an hour or so of work on most days. Build your study system to allow for many small chunks of work, make the material familiar, and get a good feel for the information. Tack on a couple extra hours of studying over the weekend, and you'll already have ten hours of review under your belt with seven days to spare without having to work more than an hour or two at a time. As you come into the week before the exam, keep studying just an hour or so a day, racking up your review hours and moving through your study system slowly but steadily. And then, during the final two days before the exam, put in longer three-hour sessions to really cement the now very familiar material into your mind. By the time your pen hits paper on the big day you will be untouchable! The exam won't stand a chance. And best of all, you got prepared with no late nights, no all-day study grinds, and no caffeine-induced hallucinations that your art history textbook is trying to poison you. Studying two weeks in advance may sound crazy at first. But once you realize that you are just spreading the necessary work out over time, not increasing the total amount of work you do, you should come to understand that this approach is a painless and highly effective method for test preparation. If you fear that you lack the willpower to get started so early, I challenge you to try this approach just once. Do it for a test early in the term when you don't feel so overwhelmed by other obligations. After you have experienced the joy of dominating a test without any hard work, I guarantee you will be converted.\"",

        "title": "\"When interviewing people for this book, I came across one student in particular who seemed to possess a wonderful sense of contentment. He was of course extraordinarily accomplished, but his happiness did not stem from specific achievements.",
        "body": "He seemed to be immune to the pressures or stresses of becoming a top-tier student. Intrigued, I pushed him to reveal more about his philosophy on life, the root of his contentment. And he finally rewarded me with a simple piece of advice: “Don't have regrets.” This sage quip had been passed to him by a family friend whom he greatly admired, and he had taken the words to heart.\n\nTo not have “regrets” is to approach life with a sense of excitement and possibility. It's to be happy about your opportunities, not your successes. The fact that you are able to have the experience of going for a major award, pursuing an interesting research project, or starting a student organization is a great affirmation of your zest for life. If you fail, why waste time with regrets? Be thankful for the experience and ask what's next?\n\nI conclude this book with these words because I believe that pursuing your ambitions for the right reasons is more important than any specific strategy for succeeding at college. If you want to succeed because you like the attention, then this book can't help you. If you want succeed to prove yourself to others, then this book can't help you. If you want to succeed because you enjoy adulation and praise, then this book can't help you. You will never really win, because the fear of failure will always be lurking around the next corner.\n\nIf, however, you want to succeed because you love the excitement of pushing your potential and exploring your world and new experiences, if you want to succeed because life is short and why not fill it with as much activity as possible, then you will win. If you approach life with an attitude of never having regrets and always having a hopeful smile on your face, you can find a measure of success in all your endeavors. Don't have regrets, but have plenty of fun along the way. In the end, that is what it is to really win.\"",

        "title": "\"I realized what the other employees already knew—that the most successful waiter in the place was Vincent, who somehow arranged for patrons to order more and tip higher than for anyone else; in fact, the other servers were not even close to him in weekly earnings.",
        "body": "So I began to linger in my duties around Vincent’s tables to observe his style. I quickly learned that his style was to have no single style. He had a repertoire of them, each ready to be called on under the appropriate circumstances. When the customers were a family, he was effervescent—even slightly clownish—directing his remarks as often to the children as to the adults. With a young couple on a date, he became formal and a bit imperious in an attempt to intimidate the young man (to whom he spoke exclusively) into ordering and tipping lavishly. With an older, married couple, he retained the formality but dropped the superior air in favor of a respectful orientation to both members of the couple. Should the patron be dining alone, Vincent selected a friendly demeanor—cordial, conversational, and warm. But Vincent reserved the trick of seeming to argue against his own interests for large parties of eight to twelve people. Here his technique was veined with genius. When it was time for the first person, normally a lady, to order, he went into his act. No matter what she selected, Vincent reacted identically: His brow furrowed, his hand hovered above his order pad, and after looking quickly over his shoulder for the manager, he leaned conspiratorially toward the table to report for all to hear, “I’m afraid that is not as good tonight as it normally is. Might I recommend instead the \\_\\_\\_\\_or the\\_\\_\\_\\_?” (Here Vincent suggested a pair of menu items that were fifty cents or so less expensive than the dish the patron had selected initially.) “They are both excellent tonight.” With this single maneuver, Vincent engaged several important principles of influence. First, even those who did not take his suggestions felt that Vincent had done them a favor by offering valuable information to help them order. Everyone felt grateful, and consequently the rule for reciprocity would work in his favor when it came time to decide on his gratuity. But besides hiking the percentage of his tip, Vincent’s maneuver also placed him in a favorable position to increase the size of the table’s order. It established him as an authority on the current stores of the house; he clearly knew what was and wasn’t good that night. Moreover—and this is where seeming to argue against his own interests came in—it proved him to be a trustworthy informant, because he recommended dishes that were slightly less expensive than originally ordered. Rather than trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have the customers’ best interests at heart. To all appearances, he was at once knowledgeable and honest, a combination that gave him great credibility. And Vincent was quick to exploit the advantage of this credible image. When the party had finished giving their food orders, he would say, “Very well, and would you like me to suggest or select some wine to go with your meals?” As I watched the scene repeated almost nightly, there was a notable consistency to the customers’ reactions—smiles, nods, and for the most part, general assent. Even from the distance of my vantage point, one could read their thoughts from their faces. “Sure,” they seemed to say, “you know what’s good here, and you’re obviously on our side. Tell us what to get.” Looking pleased, Vincent, who did know his vintages, would respond with some excellent (and costly) choices. He was similarly persuasive when it came time for dessert decisions. Patrons who otherwise would have passed up the dessert course or shared with a friend were swayed to partake fully by Vincent’s rapturous descriptions of the Baked Alaska and chocolate mousse. Who, after all, is more believable than a demonstrated expert of proven sincerity? By combining the factors of reciprocity and credible authority into a single, elegant maneuver, Vincent was able to inflate substantially both the percentage of his tip and the base charge on which it was figured. His proceeds from this trick were handsome, indeed. But notice that much of his profit came from an apparent lack of concern for personal profit. Seeming to argue against his financial interests served those interests extremely well.\"",

In your personal or professional life, the equivalent of asking yourself which clothes you love is asking yourself, “Will this activity or effort make the highest possible contribution toward my goal?”\n\n2. ELIMINATE\nLet’s say you have your clothes divided into piles of “must keep” and “probably should get rid of.” But are you really ready to stuff the “probably should get rid of” pile in a bag and send it off? After all, there is still a feeling of sunk-cost bias: studies have found that we tend to value things we already own more highly than they are worth and thus that we find them more difficult to get rid of. If you’re not quite there, ask the killer question: “If I didn’t already own this, how much would I spend to buy it?” This usually does the trick. In other words, it’s not enough to simply determine which activities and efforts don’t make the highest possible contribution; you still have to actively eliminate those that do not. Part Two of this book will show you how to eliminate the non-essentials, and not only that, how do it in a way that garners you respect from colleagues, bosses, clients, and peers.\n\n3. EXECUTE If you want your closet to stay tidy, you need a regular routine for organizing it. You need one large bag for items you need to throw away and a very small pile for items you want to keep. You need to know the dropoff location and hours of your local thrift store. You need to have a scheduled time to go there. In other words, once you’ve figured out which activities and efforts to keep—the ones that make your highest level of contribution—you need a system to make executing your intentions as effortless as possible.\"",

By “protecting their asset” they are able to go about their daily lives with a reserve of energy, creativity, and problem-solving ability to call upon when needed—unlike Nonessentialists, who can never know when and where they’ll be hijacked by their own fatigue. Essentialists choose to do one fewer thing right now in order to do more tomorrow. Yes, it is a trade-off. But cumulatively, this small trade-off can yield big rewards.\"",

        "body": "The value of play in our lives can’t be overstated. Studies from the animal kingdom reveal that play is so crucial to the development of key cognitive skills it may even play a role in a species’ survival. Bob Fagan, a researcher who has spent fifteen years studying the behavior of grizzly bears, discovered bears who played the most tended to survive the longest. When asked why, he said, “In a world continuously presenting unique challenges and ambiguity, play prepares these bears for a changing planet.”4 Jaak Panksepp concluded something similar in Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal Emotions, where he wrote, “One thing is certain, during play, animals are especially prone to behave in flexible and creative ways.”5 Yet of all animal species, Stuart Brown writes, humans are the\nbiggest players of all. We are built to play and built through play. When we play, we are engaged in the purest expression of our humanity, the truest expression of our individuality. Is it any wonder that often the times we feel most alive, those that make up our best memories, are moments of play? Play expands our minds in ways that allow us to explore: to germinate new ideas or see old ideas in a new light. It makes us more inquisitive, more attuned to novelty, more engaged. Play is fundamental to living the way of the Essentialist because it fuels exploration in at least three specific ways. First, play broadens the range of options available to us. It helps\nus to see possibilities we otherwise wouldn’t have seen and make connections we would otherwise not have made. It opens our minds and broadens our perspective. It helps us challenge old assumptions and makes us more receptive to untested ideas. It gives us permission to expand our own stream of consciousness and come up with new stories. Or as Albert Einstein once said: “When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.”\n\n Second, play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because\nstress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain. You know how it feels: you’re stressed about work and suddenly everything starts going wrong. You can’t find your keys, you bump into things more easily, you forget the critical report on the kitchen table. Recent findings suggest this is because stress increases the activity in the part of the brain that monitors emotions (the amygdala), while reducing the activity in the part responsible for cognitive function (the hippocampus)7—the result being, simply, that we really can’t think clearly. I have seen play reverse these effects in my own children. When\nthey are stressed and things feel out of control, I have them draw. When they do, the change is almost immediate. The stress melts away and their ability to explore is regained. Third, as Edward M. Hallowell, a psychiatrist who specializes in\nbrain science, explains, play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain. “The brain’s executive functions,” he writes, “include planning, prioritizing, scheduling, anticipating, delegating, deciding, analyzing—in short, most of the skills any executive\n must master in order to excel in business.” \"",

The best violinists slept an average of 8.6 hours in every twenty-four-hour period: about an hour longer than the average American. Over the period of a week they also spent an average of 2.8 hours of napping in the afternoon: about two hours longer than the average. Sleep, the authors of the study concluded, allowed these top performers to regenerate so that they could practice with greater concentration.

By definition, applying highly selective criteria is a trade-offs; sometimes you will have to turn down a seemingly very good option and have faith that the perfect option will soon come along. Sometimes it will, and sometimes it won’t, but the point is that the very act of applying selective criteria forces you to choose which perfect option to wait for, rather than letting other people, or the universe, choose for you.

        "title": "\"So how do we learn to say no gracefully? Below are general guidelines followed by a number of specific scripts for delivering the graceful \"no.\"",
        "body": "SEPARATE THE DECISION FROM THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nWhen people ask us to do something, we can confuse the request with our relationship with them. Sometimes they seem so interconnected, we forget that denying the request is not the same as denying the person. Only once we separate the decision from the relationship can we make a clear decision and then separately find the courage and compassion to communicate it.\n\nSAYING “NO” GRACEFULLY DOESN’T HAVE TO MEAN USING THE WORD NO\n\nEssentialists choose “no” more often than they say no. There may be a time when the most graceful way to say no is to simply say a blunt no. But whether it’s “I am flattered that you thought of me but I’m afraid I don’t have the bandwidth” or “I would very much like to but I’m overcommitted,” there are a variety of ways of refusing someone clearly and politely without actually using the word no.\n\nFOCUS ON THE TRADE-OFF\n\nThe more we think about what we are giving up when we say yes to someone, the easier it is to say no. If we have no clear sense of the opportunity cost—in other words, the value of what we are giving up—then it is especially easy to fall into the nonessential trap of telling ourselves we can get it all done. We can’t. A graceful “no” grows out of a clear but unstated calculation of the trade-off.\n\nREMIND YOURSELF THAT EVERYONE IS SELLING SOMETHING\n\nThis doesn’t mean you have to be cynical about people. I don’t mean to imply people shouldn’t be trusted. I am simply saying everyone is selling something—an idea, a viewpoint, an opinion—in exchange for your time. Simply being aware of what is being sold allows us to be more deliberate in deciding whether we want to buy it.\n\nMAKE YOUR PEACE WITH THE FACT THAT SAYING “NO” OFTEN REQUIRES TRADING POPULARITY FOR RESPECT\n\nWhen you say no, there is usually a short-term impact on the relationship. After all, when someone asks for something and doesn’t get it, his or her immediate reaction may be annoyance or disappointment or even anger. This downside is clear. The potential upside, however, is less obvious: when the initial annoyance or disappointment or anger wears off, the respect kicks in. When we push back effectively, it shows people that our time is highly valuable. It distinguishes the professional from the amateur.\n\nA case in point is the time the graphic designer Paul Rand had the guts to say no to Steve Jobs. When Jobs was looking for a logo for the company NeXT, he asked Rand, whose work included the logos for IBM, UPS, Enron, Westinghouse, and ABC, to come up with a few options. But Rand didn’t want to come up with “a few options.” He wanted to design just one option. So Rand said: “No. I will solve your problem for you. And you will pay me. And you don’t have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people. But I will solve the problem the best way I know how. And you use it or not. That’s up to you.” Not surprisingly, Rand solved the problem and created the “jewel” logo Jobs wanted, but the real lesson here is the effect Rand’s “push back” had on Jobs, who later said of Rand, “He is one of the most professional people I have ever worked with: in the sense that he had thought through all of the formal relationship between a client and a professional such as himself.” Rand took a risk when he said no. He bet a short-term popularity loss for a long-term gain in respect. And it paid off.\n\nEssentialists accept they cannot be popular with everyone all of the time. Yes, saying no respectfully, reasonably, and gracefully can come at a short-term social cost. But part of living the way of the Essentialist is realizing respect is far more valuable than popularity in the long run.\n\nREMEBERTHAT A CLEAR “NO” CAN BE MORE GRACEFUL THAN A VAGUE OR NONCOMMITTAL “YES”\n\nAs anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of this situation knows, a clear “I am going to pass on this” is far better than not getting back to someone or stringing them along with some noncommittal answer like “I will try to make this work” or “I might be able to” when you know you can’t. Being vague is not the same as being graceful, and delaying the eventual “no” will only make it that much harder—and the recipient that much more resentful.\"",

        "title": "\"The “No” Repertoire",
        "body": "Essentialists don’t say no just occasionally. It is a part of their regular repertoire. To consistently say no with grace, then, it helps to have a variety of responses to call upon.\n\n1\\. The awkward pause. Instead of being controlled by the threat of an awkward silence, own it. Use it as a tool. When a request comes to you (obviously this works only in person), just pause for a moment. Count to three before delivering your verdict. Or if you get a bit more bold, simply wait for the other person to fill the void.\n\n2\\. The soft “no” (or the “no but”). I recently received an e-mail inviting me to coffee. I replied: “I am consumed with writing my book right now :) But I would love to get together once the book is finished. Let me know if we can get together towards the end of the summer.” E-mail is also a good way to start practicing saying “no but” because it gives you the chance to draft and redraft your “no” to make it as graceful as possible. Plus, many people find that the distance of e-mail reduces the fear of awkwardness.\n\n3\\. “Let me check my calendar and get back to you.” One leader I know found her time being hijacked by other people all day. A classic Nonessentialist, she was capable and smart and unable to say no, and as a result she soon became a “go to” person. People would run up to her and say, “Could you help with X project?” Meaning to be a good citizen, she said yes. But soon she felt burdened with all of these different agendas. Things changed for her when she learned to use a new phrase: “Let me check my calendar and get back to you.” It gave her the time to pause and reflect and ultimately reply that she was regretfully unavailable. It enabled her to take back control of her own decisions rather than be rushed into a “yes” when she was asked.\n\n4\\. Use e-mail bouncebacks. It is totally natural and expected to get an autoresponse when someone is traveling or out of the office. Really, this is the most socially acceptable “no” there is. People aren’t saying they don’t want to reply to your e-mail, they’re just saying they can’t get back to you for a period of time. So why limit these to vacations and holidays? When I was writing this book I set an e-mail bounceback with the subject line “In Monk Mode.” The e\u0002mail said: “Dear Friends, I am currently working on a new book which has put enormous burdens on my time. Unfortunately, I am unable to respond in the manner I would like. For this, I apologize. —Greg.” And guess what? People seemed to adapt to my temporary absence and nonresponsiveness just fine.\n\n5\\. Say, “Yes. What should I deprioritize?” Saying no to a senior leader at work is almost unthinkable, even laughable, for many people. However, when saying yes is going to compromise your ability to make the highest level of contribution to your work, it is also your obligation. In this case it is not only reasonable to say no, it is essential. One effective way to do that is to remind your superiors what you would be neglecting if you said yes and force them to grapple with the trade-off. \n\nFor example, if your manager comes to you and asks you to do X, you can respond with “Yes, I’m happy to make this the priority. Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?” Or simply say, “I would want to do a great job, and given my other commitments I wouldn’t be able to do a job I was proud of if I took this on.” I know a leader who received this response from a subordinate. There was no way he wanted to be responsible for disrupting this productive and organized employee, so he took the nonessential work project back and gave it to someone else who was less organized!\n\n6\\. Say it with humor. I recently was asked by a friend to join him in training for a marathon. My response was simple: “Nope!” He laughed a little and said, “Ah, you practice what you preach.” Just goes to show how useful it is to have a reputation as an Essentialist! \n\n7\\. Use the words “You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y.” For example, “You are welcome to borrow my car. I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you.” By this you are also saying, “I won’t be able to drive you.” You are saying what you will not do, but you are couching it in terms of what you are willing to do. This is a particularly good way to navigate a request you would like to support somewhat but cannot throw your full weight behind. I particularly like this construct because it also expresses a respect for the other person’s ability to choose, as well as your own. It reminds both parties of the choices they have.\n\n8\\. “I can’t do it, but X might be interested.” It is tempting to think that our help is uniquely invaluable, but often people requesting something don’t really care if we’re the ones who help them—as long as they get the help. \"",

To illustrate this he gave the following scenario to a group of participants: “Assume that you have spent $100 on a ticket for a weekend ski trip to Michigan. Several weeks later you buy a $50 ticket for a weekend ski trip to Wisconsin. You think you will enjoy the Wisconsin ski trip more than the Michigan ski trip. As you are putting your newly purchased Wisconsin ticket in your wallet you notice that the Michigan ski trip and the Wisconsin ski trip are for the same weekend. It’s too late to sell or return either ticket. You must choose which to use.” When asked, “Which ski trip will you go on?” more than half said they would opt for the more expensive trip, even though they would enjoy it less. Their (faulty) reasoning was that using the cheaper ticket would be wasting more money than using the expensive ticket. It’s natural not to want to let go of what we wasted on a bad choice, but when we don’t, we doom ourselves to keep wasting even more.\"",

This is because of something called “the endowment effect,” our tendency to undervalue things that aren’t ours and to overvalue things because we already own them.\n\nPRETEND YOU DON’T OWN IT YET\n\nInstead of asking, “How much do I value this item?” we should ask, “If I did not own this item, how much would I pay to obtain it?” We can do the same for opportunities and commitment.

When we remain in denial, on the other hand, we continue to circle pointlessly. There should be no shame in admitting to a mistake; after all, we really are only admitting that we are now wiser than we once were.\n\nSTOP TRYING TO FORCE A FIT\n\nWhether in our personal or professional lives, it is all too tempting to force something that is simply a mismatch.\n\nGET A NEUTRAL SECOND OPINION\n\nWhen we get so emotionally hung up on trying to force something that is not the right fit, we can often benefit from a sounding board. Someone who is not emotionally involved in the situation and unaffected by the choice we make can give us the permission to stop forcing something that is clearly not working out.\n\nBE AWARE OF THE STATUS QUO BIAS\n\nIt’s all too easy to blindly accept and not bother to question commitments simply because they have already been established. One cure for the status quo bias is borrowed from the world of accounting:\n\nAPPLY ZERO-BASED BUDGETING\n\nTypically, when accountants allocate a budget they use last year’s budget as the baseline for the next year’s projection. But with zero-based budgeting, they use zero as the baseline. In other words, every item in the proposed budget must be justified  from scratch. While this takes more effort it has many advantages: it efficiently allocates resources on the basis of needs rather than history, it detects exaggerated budget requests, it draws attention to obsolete operations, and it encourages people to be clearer in their purpose and how their expenses align to that project. You can apply zero-based budgeting to your own endeavors. Instead of trying to budget your time on the basis of existing commitments, assume that all bets are off. All previous commitments are gone. Then begin from scratch, asking which you would add today. You can do this with everything from the financial obligations you have to projects you are committed to, even relationships you are in. Every use of time, energy, or resources has to justify itself anew. If it no longer fits, eliminate it altogether.\n\nSTOP MAKING CASUAL COMMITMENTS\n\nSome people’s days are full to the brim with soft commitments they have taken on unintentionally through an offhand comment or casual conversation they had somewhere with someone.\n\nFROM NOW ON, PAUSE BEFORE YOU SPEAK\n\nIt might sound obvious, but pausing for just five seconds before offering your services can greatly reduce the possibility of making a commitment you’ll regret. Before the words “That sounds great, I’d love to” fly out of your mouth, ask yourself, “Is this essential?” If you’ve already made a casual commitment you’re regretting, find a nice way to worm your way out. Simply apologize and tell the person that when you made the commitment you didn’t fully realize what it would entail.\n\nGET OVER THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT\n\nWe’ve seen ample evidence in this chapter suggesting that the majority of us are naturally very loss-averse. As a result, one of the obstacles to uncommitting ourselves from a present course is the fear of missing out on something great.\n\nTO FIGHT THIS FEAR, RUN A REVERSE PILOT\n\nIn a reverse pilot you test whether removing an initiative or activity will have any negative consequences. For example, when an executive I work with took on a new senior role in the company, he inherited a process his predecessor had gone to a huge effort to implement: a huge, highly visual report on a myriad of subjects produced for the other executives each week. It consumed enormous energy from his team, and he hypothesized that it was not adding a great deal of value to the company. So to test his hypothesis he ran a reverse pilot. He simply stopped publishing the report and waited to see what the response would be. What he found was that no one seemed to miss it; after several weeks nobody had even mentioned the report. As a result, he concluded that the report was not essential to the business and could be eliminated. By quietly eliminating or at least scaling back an activity for a few days or weeks you might be able to assess whether it is really making a difference or whether no one really cares.\"",

Instead, they took the time to find out what really mattered. They went to Nepal to see the challenge firsthand. That’s when they discovered 80 percent of babies were born at home, not in the hospital, in rural villages with no electricity. Thus the team’s real challenge, it suddenly became clear, was to create something that did not require electricity at all. With that key insight they began in earnest to solve the problem at hand. Eventually Jane and three other teammates launched a nonprofit company called “Embrace” and created the “Embrace Nest,” which uses a waxlike substance that is heated in water, then placed in the sleeping bag–like pod, where it can warm a baby for six hours or more. By getting out there and fully exploring the problem, they were able to better clarify the question and in turn to focus on the essential details that ultimately allowed them to make the highest contribution to the problem.\"",

        "title": "\"When to Sell And When Not To",
        "body": "There are many good reasons why an investor might decide to sell\ncommon stocks. He may want to build a new home or finance his son in\na business. Any one of a number of similar reasons can, from the\nstandpoint of happy living, make selling common stocks sensible. This\ntype of selling, however, is personal rather than financial in its motive.\nAs such it is well beyond the scope of this book. These com-ments are\nonly designed to cover that type of selling that is motivated by a single\nobjective—obtaining the greatest total dollar benefit from the investment\ndollars available.\nI believe there are three reasons, and three reasons only, for the sale of\nany common stock which has been originally selected according to the\ninvestment principles already discussed. The first of these reasons should\nbe obvious to anyone. This is when a mistake has been made in the\noriginal purchase and it becomes increasingly clear that the fac-tual\nbackground of the particular company is, by a significant margin, less\nfavorable than originally believed. The proper handling of this type of\nsituation is largely a matter of emotional self-control. To some degree it\nalso depends upon the investor's ability to be honest with himself.\nTwo of the important characteristics of common stock investment are the\nlarge profits that can come with proper handling, and the high degree of\nskill, knowledge, and judgment required for such proper han-dling. Since\nthe process of obtaining these almost fantastic profits is so complex, it is\nnot surprising that a certain percentage of errors in purchasing are sure to\noccur. Fortunately the long-range profits from really good common\nstocks should more than balance the losses from a nor-mal percentage of\nsuch mistakes. They should leave a tremendous mar-gin of gain as well.\nThis is particularly true if the mistake is recognized quickly. When this\nhappens, losses, if any, should be far smaller than if the stock bought in\nerror had been held for a long period of time. Even more important, the\nfunds tied up in the undesirable situation are freed to be used for\nsomething else which, if properly selected, should produce substantial\ngains.\nHowever, there is a complicating factor that makes the handling of\ninvestment mistakes more difficult. This is the ego in each of us. None of\nus likes to admit to himself that he has been wrong. If we have made a\nmistake in buying a stock but can sell the stock at a small profit, we have\nsomehow lost any sense of having been foolish. On the other hand, if we\nsell at a small loss we are quite unhappy about the whole matter. This\nreaction, while completely natural and normal, is probably one of the\nmost dangerous in which we can indulge ourselves in the entire\ninvestment process. More money has probably been lost by investors\nholding a stock they really did not want until they could “at least come\nout even” than from any other single reason. If to these actual losses are\nadded the profits that might have been made through the proper\nreinvestment of these funds if such reinvestment had been made when\nthe mistake was first realized, the cost of self-indulgence becomes truly\ntremendous.\nFurthermore this dislike of taking a loss, even a small loss, is just as\nillogical as it is natural. If the real object of common stock investment is\nthe making of a gain of a great many hundreds per cent over a period of\nyears, the difference between, say, a 20 per cent loss or a 5 per cent profit\nbecomes a comparatively insignificant matter. What matters is not\nwhether a loss occasionally occurs. What does matter is whether worth\u0002while profits so often fail to materialize that the skill of the investor or\nhis advisor in handling investments must be questioned.\nWhile losses should never cause strong self-disgust or emotional upset,\nneither should they be passed over lightly. They should always be\nreviewed with care so that a lesson is learned from each of them. If the\nparticular elements which caused a misjudgment on a common stock\npurchase are thoroughly understood, it is unlikely that another poor\npurchase will be made through misjudging the same investment factors.\nWe come now to the second reason why sale should be made of a\ncommon stock purchased under the investment principles already out\u0002lined in Chapters Two and Three. Sales should always be made of the\nstock of a company which, because of changes resulting from the pas\u0002sage of time, no longer qualifies in regard to the fifteen points outlined in\nChapter Three to about the same degree it qualified at the time of\npurchase. This is why investors should be constantly on their guard. It\nexplains why it is of such importance to keep at all times in close contact\nwith the affairs of companies whose shares are held.\nWhen companies deteriorate in this way they usually do so for one of\ntwo reasons. Either there has been a deterioration of management, or the\ncompany no longer has the prospect of increasing the markets for its\nproduct in the way it formerly did. Sometimes management deteri-orates\nbecause success has affected one or more key executives. Smug-ness,\ncomplacency, or inertia replace the former drive and ingenuity. More\noften it occurs because a new set of top executives do not meas-ure up to\nthe standard of performance set by their predecessors. Either they no\nlonger hold to the policies that have made the company outstandingly\nsuccessful, or they do not have the ability to continue to carry out such\npolicies. When any of these things happen the affected stock should be\nsold at once, regardless of how good the general market may look or how\nbig the capital gains tax may be.\nSimilarly it sometimes happens that after growing spectacularly for\nmany years, a company will reach a stage where the growth prospects of\nits markets are exhausted. From this time on it will only do about as well\nas industry as a whole. It will only progress at about the same rate as the\nnational economy does. This change may not be due to any deterioration\nof the management. Many managements show great skill in developing\nrelated or allied products to take advantage of growth in their immediate\nfield. They recognize, however, that they do not have any particular\nadvantage if they go into unrelated spheres of activity. Hence, if after\nyears of being experts in a young and growing industry, times change\nand the company has pretty well exhausted the growth prospects of its\nmarket, its shares have deteriorated in an important way from the\nstandards outlined under our frequently mentioned fifteen points. Such a\nstock should then be sold.\nIn this instance, selling might take place at a more leisurely pace than if\nmanagement deterioration had set in. Possibly part of the holding might\nbe kept until a more suitable investment could be found. However, in any\nevent, the company should be recognized as no longer suitable for worth\u0002while investment. The amount of capital gains tax, no matter how large,\nshould seldom prevent the switching of such funds into some other situ\u0002ation which, in the years ahead, may grow in a manner similar to the way\nin which this investment formerly grew.\nThere is a good test as to whether companies no longer adequately\nqualify in regard to this matter of expected further growth. This is for the\ninvestor to ask himself whether at the next peak of a business cycle,\nregardless of what may happen in the meantime, the comparative per-\nshare earnings (after allowances for stock dividends and stock splits but\nnot for new shares issued for additional capital) will probably show at\nleast as great an increase from present levels as the present levels show\nfrom the last known peak of general business activity. If the answer is in\nthe affirmative, the stock probably should be held. If in the negative, it\nshould probably be sold.\nFor those who follow the right principles in making their original\npurchases, the third reason why a stock might be sold seldom arises, and\nshould be acted upon only if an investor is very sure of his ground. It\narises from the fact that opportunities for attractive investment are\nextremely hard to find. From a timing standpoint, they are seldom found\njust when investment funds happen to be available. If an investor has had\nfunds for investment for quite a period of time and found few attractive\nsituations into which to place these funds, he may well place some or all\nof them in a well-run company which he believes has def-inite growth\nprospects. However, these growth prospects may be at a slower average\nannual rate than may appear to be the case for some other seemingly\nmore attractive situation that is found later. The already-owned company\nmay in some other important aspects appear to be less attractive as well.\nIf the evidence is clear-cut and the investor feels quite sure of his ground,\nit will, even after paying capital gains taxes, probably pay him\nhandsomely to switch into the situation with seemingly better prospects.\nThe company that can show an average annual increase of 12 per cent\nfor a long period of years should be a source of considerable financial\nsatisfaction to its owners. However, the difference between these results\nand those that could occur from a company showing a 20 per cent\naverage annual gain would be well worth the additional trouble and\ncapital gains taxes that might be involved.\nA word of caution may not be amiss, however, in regard to too read-ily\nselling a common stock in the hope of switching these funds into a still\nbetter one. There is always the risk that some major element in the\npicture has been misjudged. If this happens, the investment probably will\nnot turn out nearly as well as anticipated. In contrast, an alert investor\nwho has held a good stock for some time usually gets to know its less\ndesirable as well as its more desirable characteristics. Therefore, before\nselling a rather satisfactory holding in order to get a still better one, there\nis need of the greatest care in trying to appraise accurately all elements\nof the situation.\nAt this point the critical reader has probably discerned a basic investment\nprinciple which by and large seems only to be understood by a small\nminority of successful investors. This is that once a stock has been\nproperly selected and has borne the test of time, it is only occasionally\nthat there is any reason for selling it at all. However, recommendations\nand comments continue to pour out of the financial community giving\nother types of reasons for selling outstanding common stocks. What\nabout the validity of such reasons?\nMost frequently given of such reasons is the conviction that a gen-eral\nstock market decline of some proportion is somewhere in the offing. In\nthe preceding chapter I tried to show that postponing an attrac-tive\npurchase because of fear of what the general market might do will, over\nthe years, prove very costly. This is because the investor is ignoring a\npowerful influence about which he has positive knowledge through fear\nof a less powerful force about which, in the present state of human\nknowledge, he and everyone else is largely guessing. If the argument is\nvalid that the purchase of attractive common stocks should not be unduly\ninfluenced by fear of ordinary bear markets, the argument against selling\noutstanding stocks because of these fears is even more impressive. All\nthe arguments mentioned in the previous chapter equally apply here.\nFurthermore, the chance of the investor being right in making such sales\nis still further diminished by the factor of the capital gains tax. Because\nof the very large profits such outstanding stocks should be showing if\nthey have been held for a period of years, this cap-ital gains tax can still\nfurther accentuate the cost of making such sales.\nThere is another and even more costly reason why an investor should\nnever sell out of an outstanding situation because of the possibility that\nan ordinary bear market may be about to occur. If the com-pany is really\na right one, the next bull market should see the stock mak-ing a new\npeak well above those so far attained. How is the investor to know when\nto buy back? Theoretically it should be after the coming decline.\nHowever, this presupposes that the investor will know when the decline\nwill end. I have seen many investors dispose of a holding that was to\nshow stupendous gain in the years ahead because of this fear of a coming\nbear market. Frequently the bear market never came and the stock went\nright on up. When a bear market has come, I have not seen one time in\nten when the investor actually got back into the same shares before they\nhad gone up above his selling price. Usually he either waited for them to\ngo far lower than they actually dropped, or, when they were way down,\nfear of something else happening still prevented their reinstatement.\nThis brings us to another line of reasoning so often used to cause well\u0002intentioned but unsophisticated investors to miss huge future prof-its.\nThis is the argument that an outstanding stock has become over-priced\nand therefore should be sold. What is more logical than this? If a stock is\noverpriced, why not sell it rather than keep it?\nBefore reaching hasty conclusions, let us look a little bit below the\nsurface. Just what is overpriced? What are we trying to accomplish? Any\nreally good stock will sell and should sell at a higher ratio to current\nearnings than a stock with a stable rather than an expanding earning\npower. After all, this probability of participating in continued growth is\nobviously worth something. When we say that the stock is overpriced,\nwe may mean that it is selling at an even higher ratio in relation to this\nexpected earning power than we believe it should be. Possibly we may\nmean that it is selling at an even higher ratio than are other comparable\nstocks with similar prospects of materially increasing their future\nearnings.\nAll of this is trying to measure something with a greater degree of\npreciseness than is possible. The investor cannot pinpoint just how much\nper share a particular company will earn two years from now. He can at\nbest judge this within such general and non-mathematical limits as\n“about the same,” “up moderately,” “up a lot,” or “up tremendously.” As\na matter of fact, the company's top management cannot come a great deal\ncloser than this. Either they or the investor should come pretty close in\njudging whether a sizable increase in average earnings is likely to occur\na few years from now. But just how much increase, or the exact year in\nwhich it will occur, usually involves guessing on enough vari-ables to\nmake precise predictions impossible.\nUnder these circumstances, how can anyone say with even moderate\nprecision just what is overpriced for an outstanding company with an\nunusually rapid growth rate? Suppose that instead of selling at\ntwentyfive times earnings, as usually happens, the stock is now at thirty\u0002five times earnings. Perhaps there are new products in the immediate\nfuture, the real economic importance of which the financial community\nhas not yet grasped. Perhaps there are not any such products. If the\ngrowth rate is so good that in another ten years the company might well\nhave quadrupled, is it really of such great concern whether at the\nmoment the stock might or might not be 35 per cent overpriced? That\nwhich really matters is not to disturb a position that is going to be worth\na great deal more later.\nAgain our old friend the capital gains tax adds its bit to these\nconclusions. Growth stocks which are recommended for sale because\nthey are supposedly overpriced nearly always will cost their owners a\nsizable cap-ital gains tax if they are sold. Therefore, in addition to the\nrisk of losing a permanent position in a company which over the years\nshould continue to show unusual further gains, we also incur a sizable\ntax liability. Isn't it safer and cheaper simply to make up our minds that\nmomentarily the stock may be somewhat ahead of itself? We already\nhave a sizable profit in it. If for a while the stock loses, say, 35 per cent\nof its current market quotation, is this really such a serious matter?\nAgain, isn't the maintaining of our position rather than the possibility of\ntemporarily losing a small part of our capital gain the matter which is\nreally important?\nThere is still one other argument investors sometimes use to sepa-rate\nthemselves from the profits they would otherwise make. This one is the\nmost ridiculous of all. It is that the stock they own has had a huge\nadvance. Therefore, just because it has gone up, it has probably used up\nmost of its potential. Consequently they should sell it and buy some\u0002thing that hasn't gone up yet. Outstanding companies, the only type\nwhich I believe the investor should buy, just don't function this way.\nHow they do function might best be understood by considering the\nfollowing somewhat fanciful analogy:\nSuppose it is the day you graduated from college. If you did not go to\ncollege, consider it to be the day of your high school graduation; from\nthe standpoint of our example it will make no difference whatsoever.\nNow suppose that on this day each of your male classmates had an\nurgent need of immediate cash. Each offered you the same deal. If you\nwould give them a sum of money equivalent to ten times whatever they\nmight earn during the first twelve months after they had gone to work,\nthat classmate would for the balance of his life turn over to you one\nquarter of each year's earnings! Finally let us suppose that, while you\nthought this was an excellent proposition, you only had spare cash on\nhand sufficient to make such a deal with three of your classmates.\nAt this point, your reasoning would closely resemble that of the investor\nusing sound investment principles in selecting common stocks. You\nwould immediately start analyzing your classmates, not from the\nstandpoint of how pleasant they might be or even how talented they\nmight be in other ways, but solely to determine how much money they\nmight make. If you were part of a large class, you would probably\neliminate quite a number solely on the ground of not knowing them\nsuffi-ciently well to be able to pass worthwhile judgment on just how\nfinan-cially proficient they actually would get to be. Here again, the\nanalogy with intelligent common stock buying runs very close.\nEventually you would pick the three classmates you felt would have the\ngreatest future earning power. You would make your deal with them. Ten\nyears have passed. One of your three has done sensationally. Going to\nwork for a large corporation, he has won promotion after promotion.\nAlready insiders in the company are saying that the president has his eye\non him and that in another ten years he will probably take the top job. He\nwill be in line for the large compensation, stock options, and pension\nbenefits that go with that job.\nUnder these circumstances, what would even the writers of stock market\nreports who urge taking profits on superb stocks that “have gotten ahead\nof the market”think of your selling out your contract with this former\nclassmate, just because someone has offered you 600 per cent on your\noriginal investment? You would think that anyone would need to have\nhis head examined if he were to advise you to sell this contract and\nreplace it with one with another former classmate whose annual earnings\nstill were about the same as when he left school ten years before. The\nargument that your successful classmate had had his advance while the\nadvance of your (financially) unsuccessful classmate still lay ahead of\nhim would probably sound rather silly. If you know your common stocks\nequally well, many of the arguments commonly heard for selling the\ngood one sound equally silly.\nYou may be thinking all this sounds fine, but actually classmates are not\ncommon stocks. To be sure, there is one major difference. That\ndifference increases rather than decreases the reason for never selling the\noutstanding common stock just because it has had a huge rise and may\nbe temporarily overpriced. This difference is that the classmate is finite,\nmay die soon and is sure to die eventually. There is no similar life span\nfor the common stock. The company behind the common stock can have\na practice of selecting management talent in depth and training such\ntalent in company policies, methods, and techniques in a way which will\nretain and pass on the corporate vigor for generations. Look at Du Pont\nin its second century of corporate existence. Look at Dow years after the\ndeath of its brilliant founder. In this era of unlimited human wants and\nincredible markets, there is no limitation to corporate growth such as the\nlife span places upon the individual.\nPerhaps the thoughts behind this chapter might be put into a single\nsentence: If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is\npurchased, the time to sell it is—almost never.\"",

Furthermore, there is no question that this\ninvestor would have made the $46,500, because he still has other shares\nof this same company which he bought at even lower figures.

        "body": "Foremost among such statistics are the price ranges at which a stock has\nsold in former years. For some reason, the first thing many investors\nwant to see when they are considering buying a particular stock is a table\ngiving the highest and lowest price at which that stock has sold in each\nof the past five or ten years. They go through a sort of mental mumbo-jumbo, and come up with a nice round figure which is the price they are\nwilling to pay for the particular stock.\n\nIs this illogical? Is it financially dangerous? The answer to both\nquestions is emphatically yes. It is dangerous because it puts the emphasis on what does not particularly matter, and diverts attention from what does matter. This frequently causes investors to pass up a situation in which they would make big profits in order to go into one where the\nprofits will be much smaller. To understand this we must see why the\nmental process is so illogical.\n\nWhat makes the price at which a stock sells? It is the composite estimate\nat that moment of what all those interested think the corrective value of\nsuch shares may be. It is the composite appraisal of the outlook for this\ncompany by all potential buyers and sellers, weighted by the number of\nshares each buyer or seller is disposed to bid for or offer, in relation to a\nsimilar appraisal, at the same moment, of the outlook for other\ncompanies with their individual prospects. Occasionally, some-thing like\nforced liquidation will produce a moderate deviation from this figure.\nThis happens when a large holder presses stock on the mar-ket for\nreasons—such as liquidating an estate or paying off a loan— which may\nnot be directly related to the seller's view of the real value of the shares.\nHowever, such pressures usually cause only moderate vari-ation from the\ncomposite appraisal of the prevailing price of the shares, since bargain\nhunters normally step in to take advantage of the situation, which thereby\nadjusts itself.\n\nThe point which is of real significance is that the price is based on the\ncurrent appraisal of the situation. As changes in the affairs of the company become known, these appraisals become correspondingly more or less favorable. In relation to other stocks, these particular shares then\nmove up or down. If the factors appraised were judged correctly, the\nstock becomes permanently more or less valuable in relation to other\nstocks. The shares then stay up or down. If more of these same factors\ncontinue to develop, they in turn are recognized by the financial\ncommunity. The stock then goes and stays either further up or down, as\nthe case may be.\n\nTherefore, the price at which the stock sold four years ago may have\nlittle or no real relationship to the price at which it sells today. The\ncompany may have developed a host of able new executives, a series of\nnew and highly profitable products, or any number of similar desirable\nattributes that make the stock intrinsically worth four times as much in\nrelation to the price of other stocks as it was worth four years ago. The\ncompany might have fallen into the hands of an inefficient management\nand slipped so badly in relation to competition that the only way recovery could occur would be through the raising of much new capital. This might force such a dilution of the shares that the stock today could not\npossibly be worth more than a quarter of the price of four years ago.\nAgainst this background, it can be seen why investors so frequently pass\nup stocks which would have brought them huge future gains, for ones\nwhere the gain is very much smaller. By giving heavy emphasis to the\n“stock that hasn't gone up yet” they are unconsciously subscribing to the\ndelusion that all stocks go up about the same amount and that the one\nthat has already risen a lot will not climb further, while the one that has\nnot yet gone up has something “due” it. Nothing could be further from\nthe truth. The fact that a stock has or has not risen in the last several\nyears is of no significance whatsoever in determining whether it should\nbe bought now. What does matter is whether enough improvement has\ntaken place or is likely to take place in the future to justify importantly\nhigher prices than those now prevailing. Similarly, many investors will give heavy weight to the per-share earnings of the past five years in trying to decide whether a stock should be bought. To look at the per-share earnings by themselves and give the earnings of four or five years ago any significance is like trying to get useful work from an engine which is unconnected to any device to which that engine's power is supposed to be applied. Just knowing, by itself, that four or five years ago a company's per-share earnings were either four times or a quarter of this year's earnings has almost no significance in indicating whether a particular stock should be bought or sold. Again, what counts is knowledge of background conditions. An understanding of what probably will happen over the next several years is of overriding importance.\n\nThe investor is constantly being fed a diet of reports and so-called\nanalyses largely centered around these price figures for the past five\nyears. He should keep in mind that it is the next five years' earnings, not\nthose of the past five years, that now matter to him.\n\nThey emphasize these past earnings records in a sincere belief that\ndetailed accounting descriptions of what happened last year will give a\ntrue picture of what will happen next year. This may be true for certain\nclasses of regulated companies such as public utilities. For the type of\nenterprise which I believe should interest an investor desiring the best\nresults for his money, it can be completely false.\"\n",

Would it be honest? She would have gone with me, but where would we go? Where could I take her? It would have been different if my life had been glamorous and interesting, if I had been fighting for the liberation of my country, for example, or was a famous scholar, an actor or an artist, but I would just be taking her from one tedious and ordinary way of life to another one exactly the same, or one that was even more tedious. And how long would our love last? What would happen if I got ill, or died, or if we simply stopped loving each other?\n\nShe had clearly thought about everything in a similar way. She thought about her husband, about her children, and about her mother, who loved her husband like a son. If she gave in to her feelings, she would have to lie or tell the truth, and both options seemed equally terrible and awkward in her position. And she was tormented by the question of whether her love would bring me happiness, and whether it would only complicate my life, which was already difficult and full of misfortune. She felt that she was not young enough for me, and not hardworking or dynamic enough to begin a new life, and she often told her husband that I should get married to an intelligent, reliable girl, who would be a good housewife and helper to me, immediately adding that it would be practically impossible to find anyone like that in the town.\"\n\nAbout Love ",

And because I’ve gotten so good at it, I really do feel I was able to pack a whole lot of life into the shortened lifespan I’ve been handed. Here’s what I know:\n\nTime must be explicitly managed, like money. My students would sometimes roll their eyes at what they called “Pauschisms,” but I stand by them. Urging students not to invest time on irrelevant details, I’d tell them: “It doesn’t matter how well you polish the underside of the banister.” \n\nYou can always change your plan, but only if you have\none. I’m a big believer in to-do lists. It helps us break life into small steps. I once put “get tenure” on my to-do list. That was naïve. The most useful to-do list breaks tasks into small\nsteps. It’s like when I encourage Logan to clean his room by picking up one thing at a time. \n\nAsk yourself: Are you spending your time on the right\nthings? You may have causes, goals, interests. Are they even worth pursuing? I’ve long held on to a clipping from a newspaper in Roanoke, Virginia. It featured a photo of a pregnant woman who had lodged a protest against a local construction site. She worried that the sound of jackhammers was injuring her unborn child. But get this: In the photo, the woman is holding a cigarette. If she cared about her unborn child, the time she spent railing against jackhammers would have been better spent putting out that cigarette.\n\n Develop a good filing system. \nWhen I told Jai I wanted to have a place in the house where we could file everything in alphabetical order, she said I sounded way too compulsive for her tastes. I told her: “Filing in alphabetical order is better than running around and saying, ‘I know it was blue and I know I was eating something when I had it.’ ”\n\nDelegate. \nAs a professor, I learned early on that I could\ntrust bright, nineteen-year-old students with the keys to my kingdom, and most of the time, they were responsible and impressive. It’s never too early to delegate. My daughter, Chloe, is just eighteen months old, but two of my favorite photos are of her in my arms. In the first, I’m giving her a bottle. In the second, I’ve delegated the task to her. She looks satisfied. Me, too.\n\nTake a time out. \nIt’s not a real vacation if you’re reading\nemail or calling in for messages.\"",

She would breathe in, imagining that she was finding ways to deal with her debts. She would breathe out, telling herself that her money problems would one day be behind her. It went on like this, Tuesday after Tuesday. Finally, one day I looked through her finances with her. I figured out that if she spent four or five months working a part-time job on Tuesday nights, she could actually pay off all the money she owed. I told her I had nothing against yoga or meditation. But I\ndid think it’s always best to try to treat the disease first. Her symptoms were stress and anxiety. Her disease was the money she owed. “Why don’t you get a job on Tuesday nights and skip yoga for a while?” I suggested. This was something of a revelation to her. And she took my advice. She became a Tuesday-night waitress and soon enough paid off her debts. After that, she could go back to yoga and really breathe easier.\"",

Meet over a meal if you can; food softens a meeting. That’s why they “do lunch” in Hollywood.\n\nLet everyone talk: Don’t finish someone’s sentences. And talking louder or faster doesn’t make your idea any better. Check egos at the door: When you discuss ideas, label them and write them down.

        "body": "Huxley addresses this question directly in the novel’s climactic moment: the\ndialogue between Mustapha Mond, the World Controller for western Europe,\nand John the Savage, who has lived all his life on a native Reservation in New Mexico, and who is the only other man in London who still knows anything about Shakespeare or God.\n\nWhen John the Savage tries to incite the people of London to rebel against the system that controls them, they react with utter apathy to his call, but the police arrest him and bring him before Mustapha Mond. The World Controller has a pleasant chat with John, explaining that if he insists on being antisocial, he should just remove himself to some secluded place and live as a hermit. John then questions the views that underlie the global order, and accuses the World Government that in its pursuit of happiness, it has eliminated not just truth and beauty, but all that is noble and heroic in life:\n\n‘My dear young friend,’ said Mustapha Mond, ‘civilization has absolutely\nno need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political\ninefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any\nopportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be\nthoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars,\nwhere there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be\nresisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended – there, obviously,\nnobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren’t any wars nowadays.\n\nThe greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving anyone too much.\nThere’s no such thing as a divided allegiance; you’re so conditioned that\nyou can’t help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on\nthe whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free\nplay, that there really aren’t any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some\nunlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there’s\nalways [the drug] soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there’s\nalways soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make\nyou patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these\nthings by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now,\nyou swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody\ncan be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a\nbottle. Christianity without tears – that’s what soma is.’\n\n‘But the tears are necessary. Don’t you remember what Othello said? “If\nafter every tempest come such calms, may the winds blow till they have\nwakened death.” There’s a story one of the old Indians used to tell us, about\nthe Girl of Mátsaki. The young men who wanted to marry her had to do a\nmorning’s hoeing in her garden. It seemed easy; but there were flies and\nmosquitoes, magic ones. Most of the young men simply couldn’t stand the\nbiting and stinging. But the one that could – he got the girl.’\n‘Charming! But in civilized countries,’ said the Controller, ‘you can have\ngirls without hoeing for them; and there aren’t any flies or mosquitoes to\nsting you. We got rid of them all centuries ago.’\nThe Savage nodded, frowning. ‘You got rid of them. Yes, that’s just like\nyou. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with\nit. Whether’tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of\noutrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by\nopposing end them … But you don’t do either. Neither suffer nor oppose.\nYou just abolish the slings and arrows. It’s too easy … What you need,’ the\nSavage went on, ‘is something with tears for a change … Isn’t there\nsomething in living dangerously?’\n‘There’s a great deal in it,’ the Controller replied. ‘Men and women must\nhave their adrenals stimulated from time to time … It’s one of the\nconditions of perfect health. That’s why we’ve made the V.P.S. treatments\ncompulsory.’\n‘V.P.S.?’\n‘Violent Passion Surrogate. Regularly once a month. We flood the whole\nsystem with adrenalin. It’s the complete physiological equivalent of fear\nand rage. All the tonic effects of murdering Desdemona and being\nmurdered by Othello, without any of the inconveniences.’\n‘But I like the inconveniences.’\n‘We don’t,’ said the Controller. ‘We prefer to do things comfortably.’\n‘But I don’t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger,\nI want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.’\n‘In fact,’ said Mustapha Mond, ‘you’re claiming the right to be unhappy.’\n‘All right then,’ said the Savage defiantly, ‘I’m claiming the right to be\nunhappy.’\n‘Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to\nhave syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be\nlousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen\ntomorrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable\npains of every kind.’\nThere was a long silence.\n‘I claim them all,’ said the Savage at last.\nMustapha Mond shrugged his shoulders. ‘You’re welcome,’ he said.\n\nJohn the Savage retires to an uninhabited wilderness, and there lives as a hermit.Years of living on an Indian reservation and of being brainwashed by\nShakespeare and religion have conditioned him to reject all the blessings of\nmodernity. But word of such an unusual and exciting fellow quickly spreads,\npeople flock to watch him and record all his doings, and soon enough he\nbecomes a celebrity. Sick to the heart of all the unwanted attention, the Savage escapes the civilised matrix not by swallowing a red pill, but by hanging himself.\"",

Stay lean and flexible\nAll companies must be “lean,” which is code for “unplanned.” You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible.Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.\n\n3. Improve on the competition\nDon’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.\n\n4. Focus on product, not sales\nIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.\n\nThese lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would\nignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:\n\n1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. \n\n2. A bad plan is better than no plan. \n\n3.

Google’s search algorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else’s. Proprietary technologies for extremely short page load times and highly accurate query autocompletion add to the core search product’s robustness and defensibility. It would be very hard for anyone to do to Google what Google did to all the other search engine companies in the early 2000s. As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times\nbetter than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something\ncompletely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness, for example, would certainly support a monopoly business.\nOr you can radically improve an existing solution: once you’re 10x better, you\nescape competition. PayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10 times better. Instead of mailing a check that would take 7 to 10 days to arrive, PayPal let buyers pay as soon as an auction ended. Sellers received their proceeds right away, and unlike with a check, they knew the funds were good. Amazon made its first 10x improvement in a particularly visible way: they offered at least 10 times as many books as any other bookstore. When it launched in 1995, Amazon could claim to be “Earth’s largest bookstore” because, unlike a retail bookstore that might stock 100,000 books, Amazon didn’t need to physically store any inventory—it simply requested the title from its supplier whenever a customer made an order. This quantum improvement was so effective that a very unhappy Barnes & Noble filed a lawsuit three days before Amazon’s IPO, claiming that Amazon was unfairly calling itself a “bookstore” when really it was a “book broker.” You can also make a 10x improvement through superior integrated design. Before 2010, tablet computing was so poor that for all practical purposes the market didn’t even exist. “Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition” products first shipped in 2002, and Nokia released its own “Internet Tablet” in 2005, but they were a pain to use. Then Apple released the iPad. Design improvements are hard to measure, but it seems clear that Apple improved on anything that had come before by at least an order of magnitude: tablets went from unusable to useful.\"",

Unilaterally choosing a different social network would only make you an eccentric. Network effects can be powerful, but you’ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small. For example, in 1960 a quixotic company called Xanadu set out to build a twoway communication network between all computers—a sort of early, synchronous version of the World Wide Web. After more than three decades of futile effort, Xanadu folded just as the web was becoming commonplace. Their technology probably would have worked at scale, but it could have worked only at scale: it required every computer to join the network at the same time, and that was never going to happen. Paradoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially\nsmall markets. Facebook started with just Harvard students—Mark Zuckerberg’s first product was designed to get all his classmates signed up, not to attract all people of Earth. This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all.\"",

        "body": "A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a product (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever greater quantities of sales. Software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale because the marginal cost of producing another copy of the product is close to zero. Many businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale.\nService businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for example, you’ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you’ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to do. A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first\ndesign. Twitter already has more than 250 million users today.

        "title": "\"4. Branding",
        "body": "A company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. Today’s strongest tech brand is Apple: the attractive looks and carefully chosen materials of products like the iPhone and MacBook, the Apple Stores’ sleek minimalist design and close control over the consumer experience, the omnipresent advertising campaigns, the price positioning as a maker of premium goods, and the lingering nimbus of Steve Jobs’s personal charisma all contribute to a perception that Apple offers products so good as to constitute a category of their own. Many have tried to learn from Apple’s success: paid advertising, branded\nstores, luxurious materials, playful keynote speeches, high prices, and even minimalist design are all susceptible to imitation. But these techniques for polishing the surface don’t work without a strong underlying substance. Apple has a complex suite of proprietary technologies, both in hardware (like superior touchscreen materials) and software (like touchscreen interfaces purposedesigned for specific materials). It manufactures products at a scale large enough to dominate pricing for the materials it buys. And it enjoys strong network effects from its content ecosystem: thousands of developers write software for Apple devices because that’s where hundreds of millions of users are, and those users stay on the platform because it’s where the apps are. These other monopolistic advantages are less obvious than Apple’s sparkling brand, but they are the fundamentals that let the branding effectively reinforce Apple’s monopoly. Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. Ever since Marissa\nMayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the oncepopular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized Mayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The people are supposed to come for the coolness: Yahoo! demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer’s own star power. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology company can be built on branding alone.\"",

Nobody needed our product, so we had no customers. With that lesson learned, we set our sights on eBay auctions, where we found\nour first success. In late 1999, eBay had a few thousand high-volume “PowerSellers,” and after only three months of dedicated effort, we were\nserving 25% of them. It was much easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to try to compete for the attention of millions of scattered individuals. The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people\nconcentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad choice, and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse. This is why it’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. In practice, a large market will either lack a good starting point or it will be open to competition, so it’s hard to ever reach that 1%.

        "title": "\"Scaling Up",
        "body": "Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff Bezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books. There were millions of books to catalog, but they all had roughly the same shape, they were easy to ship, and some of the most rarely sold books—those least profitable for any retail store to keep in stock—also drew the most enthusiastic customers. Amazon became the dominant solution for anyone located far from a bookstore or seeking something unusual. Amazon then had two options: expand the number of people who read books, or expand to adjacent markets. They chose the latter, starting with the most similar markets: CDs, videos, and software. Amazon continued to add categories gradually until it had become the world’s general store. The name itself brilliantly encapsulated the company’s scaling strategy. The biodiversity of the Amazon rain forest reflected Amazon’s first goal of cataloging every book in the world, and now it stands for every kind of thing in the world, period. eBay also started by dominating small niche markets. When it launched its auction marketplace in 1995, it didn’t need the whole world to adopt it at once; the product worked well for intense interest groups, like Beanie Baby obsessives. Once it monopolized the Beanie Baby trade, eBay didn’t jump straight to listing sports cars or industrial surplus: it continued to cater to small-time hobbyists until it became the most reliable marketplace for people trading online no matter what the item. Sometimes there are hidden obstacles to scaling—a lesson that eBay has learned in recent years. Like all marketplaces, the auction marketplace lent itself to natural monopoly because buyers go where the sellers are and vice versa. But eBay found that the auction model works best for individually distinctive products like coins and stamps. It works less well for commodity products: people don’t want to bid on pencils or Kleenex, so it’s more convenient just to buy them from Amazon. eBay is still a valuable monopoly; it’s just smaller than people in 2004 expected it to be. Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually. The most successful companies make the core progression—to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their founding narrative.\"",

Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves.

And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. \n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. \n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. \"",

At a federal law enforcement agency, investigators given monthly performance quotas were found to pick easy cases at the end of the month rather than the most urgent ones. And at a factory, focusing on production metrics led supervisors to neglect maintenance and repairs, setting up future catastrophe.

And you know therefore that this could happen the day after you invest your $120,000 and, while unlikely, that would make for a very miserable day indeed. So instead of investing all at once you decide to DCA and thus eliminate this risk. Here’s how it works.\n\nFirst you select a time period over which to deploy your $120,000; let’s\nsay the next 12 months. Then you divide your money by 12 and each month you invest $10,000. That way, if the market plunges right after your first investment you’ll have 11 more investing periods that might be better. Sounds great, right? Well it does eliminate the risk of investing all at once, but the problem is\nthat it only works as long as the market drops and the average cost of your shares over the 12 month investment period remains below the cost of the shares the day you started. Should the market rise, you’ll come out behind. You are trading one risk (the market drops after you buy) with another (the market continues to rise while you DCA, meaning you’ll pay more for your shares). So which risk is more likely? Assuming you were paying attention while reading Parts I & II, you\nknow that the market always goes up but that it is a wild ride. The other thing you know is that it goes up more often than it goes down. Consider that between 1970 and 2013, the market was up 33 out of 43 years. That’s 77% of the time.\"\n",

I use the example as computed by the mathematician Michael Berry.\n\nIf you know a set of basic parameters concerning the ball at rest, can compute the resistance of the table (quite elementary), and can gauge the \nstrength of the impact, then it is rather easy to predict what would happen at the first hit. \n\nThe second impact becomes more complicated, but possible; you need to be more careful about your knowledge of the initial states, and more precision is called for. The problem is that to correctly \ncompute the ninth impact, you need to take into account the gravitational pull of someone standing next to the table (modestly, Berry's computations use a weight of less than 150 pounds). And to compute the fifty-sixth impact, every single elementary particle of the universe needs to be present in your assumptions! An electron at the edge of the universe, separated from us by 10 billion light-years, must figure in the calculations, since it exerts a meaningful effect on the outcome. \n\nNow, consider the additional burden of having to incorporate predictions about where these variables will be in the future. Forecasting the motion of a billiard ball on a pool table requires knowledge of the dynamics of the entire universe, down to every single atom! We can easily predict the movements of large objects like planets (though not too far into the future), but the smaller entities \ncan be difficult to figure out—and there are so many more of them. Note that this billiard-ball story assumes a plain and simple world; it does not even take into account these crazy social matters possibly endowed with free will. Billiard balls do not have a mind of their own. Nor does our example take into account relativity and quantum effects.

Instead of having medium risk, you have high risk on one side and no risk on the other. The average will be medium risk but constitutes a positive exposure to the Black Swan. More technically, this can be called a \"convex\" combination. \n\nMake sure that you have plenty of these small bets; avoid being blinded by the vividness of one single Black Swan. Have as many of these small bets as you can conceivably have. Even venture capital firms fall for the narrative fallacy with a few stories that \"make sense\" to them; they do not have as many bets as they should. If venture capital firms are profitable, it is not because of the stories they have in their heads, but because they are exposed to unplanned rare events. ",

        "body": "The water is calm, the horizon endless, the air warm. As we're being invited to realise, this is our true home: which doesn't mean that this is where we can be day to day. Far from it, but this is where we long to be, this is what our hearts crave, this is where we have been trying to get to all our lives. We might attempt to look at the image for a whole minute - which is a very long time to look at anything - and to lose ourselves in the Vastness. We can meander around the sky, the sea, the horizon and the gentle ripples in the foreground. This can be our destination; this is where we should remember to steer ourselves despite the neverending distractions and too often futile and draining obligations. We will have succeeded if, after the confusion and tumult, we manage at last to be as it already is. To put it at its grandest, calm is the meaning of life. By which is meant that calm is the thing to which everything else should ultimately contribute and the measure by which it should be justified. Plenty of things are important and notable: money, friends, art, work, but if we probe hard at why they matter, if we push upstream, we eventually find that it's because of their power to contribute to something else, to what the Romans poetically knew as the 'summum bonum, the highest of all goods; a steady unruffled peaceful state of mind. That calm ocean is calling to us; it should elicit in us an ache, and a sadness. It's where we belong but have spent so little time in until now. A realm at once foreign and intimately familiar - from which we are in exile. At least the image can orient us, and give us a more secure sense of our intended eventual destination. This is where we will get to when - and if - we, finally and truly, win at life.\n\n![Screenshot_2023-03-09-14-10-38-12_f9ee0578fe1cc94de7482bd41accb329.jpg](:/4acc43b1ad4b483cb677c9802edb4f20)\n\"",

        "body": "It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'If you're so smart, why ain't You rich? ' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child's hand-glued to a lollipop stick and, flying from the cash register.\n\nAmericans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue, the monograph went on. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves. Once this is understood the disagreeable behavior of American enlisted men in German prisons ceases to be a mystery.\n\nEvery other army in history, prosperous or not, has attempted to clothe even its lowliest soldiers so as to make them impressive to themselves and others as stylish experts in drinking and copulation and looting and sudden death. The American Army, however, sends its enlisted men out to fight and die in a modified business suit quite evidently made for another man, a sterilized but unpressed gift from a noseholding charity which passes out clothing to drunks in the slums. When a dashingly-clad officer addresses such a frumpishly dressed bum, he scolds him, as an officer in an army must. But the officer's contempt is not, as in 'other armies, avuncular theatricality. It is a genuine expression of hatred for the poor, who have no one to blame for their misery but themselves. A prison administrator dealing with captured American enlisted men for the first time should be warned: Expect no brotherly love, even between brothers. There will be no cohesion between the individuals. Each will be a sulky child who often wishes he were dead.\"",

They bought new locks for their doors and gratings for their windows, to keep out The Pluto Gang. They stopped going to theaters at night, for fear of The Pluto Gang.

You appear to be the only one who can do what you do —and the appearance of having an exclusive gift is immensely powerful. Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. Your powers are untapped— no one can fathom their limits. The secrecy with which you surround your actions must seem lighthearted in spirit. A zeal to conceal your work creates an unpleasant, almost paranoiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the ultimate in cleverness.

Walking is the wrong description; they hobbled, they dragged themselves along, in many cases hanging on to each other and supporting one another; their legs, swollen and bulging from hunger edema, could barely support their bodies, weighing, on average, only forty kilograms. Their feet ached, for they were raw, covered in festering pressure sores and ulcerated chilblains. And what was going on in the brains of these men? They thought about the soup that was doled out for their only meal of the day in the evening at the camp, after returning from the work site, and wondered whether, that evening, as well as the watery broth, they would be lucky enough to grab a potato floating in it.",

        "body": "INTRODUCTION\n• Chapter 1: Living the life you want requires not only doing the right\nthings but also avoiding doing the wrong things.\n• Chapter 2: Traction moves you toward what you really want while\ndistraction moves you further away. Being indistractable means striving\nto do what you say you will do.\n\nPART 1: MASTER INTERNAL TRIGGERS\n• Chapter 3: Motivation is a desire to escape discomfort. Find the root\ncauses of distraction rather than proximate ones.\n• Chapter 4: Learn to deal with discomfort rather than attempting to\nescape it with distraction.\n• Chapter 5: Stop trying to actively suppress urges—this only makes\nthem stronger. Instead, observe and allow them to dissolve.\n• Chapter 6: Reimagine the internal trigger. Look for the negative\nemotion preceding the distraction, write it down, and pay attention to\nthe negative sensation with curiosity rather than contempt.\n• Chapter 7: Reimagine the task. Turn it into play by paying “foolish,\neven absurd” attention to it. Deliberately look for novelty.\n• Chapter 8: Reimagine your temperament. Self-talk matters. Your\nwillpower runs out only if you believe it does. Avoid labeling yourself\nas “easily distracted” or having an “addictive personality.”\n\nPART 2: MAKE TIME FOR TRACTION\n• Chapter 9: Turn your values into time. Timebox your day by creating a\nschedule template.\n• Chapter 10: Schedule time for yourself. Plan the inputs and the\noutcome will follow.\n• Chapter 11: Schedule time for important relationships. Include\nhousehold responsibilities as well as time for people you love. Put\nregular time on your schedule for friends.\n• Chapter 12: Sync your schedule with stakeholders.\n\nPART 3: HACK BACK EXTERNAL TRIGGERS\n• Chapter 13: Of each external trigger, ask: “Is this trigger serving me,\nor am I serving it?” Does it lead to traction or distraction?\n• Chapter 14: Defend your focus. Signal when you do not want to be\ninterrupted.\n• Chapter 15: To get fewer emails, send fewer emails. When you check\nemail, tag each message with when it needs a reply and respond at a\nscheduled time.\n• Chapter 16: When it comes to group chat, get in and out at scheduled\ntimes. Only involve who is necessary and don’t use it to think out loud.\n• Chapter 17: Make it harder to call meetings. No agenda, no meeting.\nMeetings are for consensus building rather than problem solving. Leave\ndevices outside the conference room except for one laptop.\n• Chapter 18: Use distracting apps on your desktop rather than your\nphone. Organize apps and manage notifications. Turn on “Do Not\nDisturb.”\n• Chapter 19: Turn off desktop notifications. Remove potential\ndistractions from your workspace.\n• Chapter 20: Save online articles in Pocket to read or listen to at a\nscheduled time. Use “multichannel multitasking.”\n• Chapter 21: Use browser extensions that give you the benefits of social\nmedia without all the distractions. Links to other tools are at:\nNirAndFar.com/Indistractable.\n\nPART 4: PREVENT DISTRACTION WITH PACTS\n• Chapter 22: The antidote to impulsiveness is forethought. Plan ahead\nfor when you’re likely to get distracted.\n• Chapter 23: Use effort pacts to make unwanted behaviors more\ndifficult.\n• Chapter 24: Use a price pact to make getting distracted expensive.\n• Chapter 25: Use identity pacts as a precommitment to a self-image.\nCall yourself “indistractable.”\n\nPART 5: HOW TO MAKE YOUR WORKPLACE INDISTRACTABLE\n• Chapter 26: An “always on” culture drives people crazy.\n• Chapter 27: Tech overuse at work is a symptom of dysfunctional\ncompany culture. The root cause is a culture lacking “psychological\nsafety.”\n• Chapter 28: To create a culture that values doing focused work, start\nsmall and find ways to facilitate an open dialogue among colleagues\nabout the problem.\n\nPART 6: HOW TO RAISE INDISTRACTABLE CHILDREN (AND WHY WE ALL NEED PSYCHOLOGICAL NUTRIENTS)\n• Chapter 29: Find the root causes of why children get distracted. Teach\nthem the four-part indistractable model.\n• Chapter 30: Make sure children’s psychological needs are met. All\npeople need to feel a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\nIf kids don’t get their needs met in the real world, they look to fulfill\nthem online.\n• Chapter 31: Teach children to timebox their schedule. Let them make\ntime for activities they enjoy, including time online.\n• Chapter 32: Work with your children to remove unhelpful external\ntriggers. Make sure they know how to turn off distracting triggers, and\ndon’t become a distracting external trigger yourself.\n• Chapter 33: Help your kids make pacts and make sure they know\nmanaging distraction is their responsibility. Teach them that distraction\nis a solvable problem and that becoming indistractable is a lifelong\nskill.\n\nPART 7: HOW TO HAVE INDISTRACTABLE RELATIONSHIPS\n• Chapter 34: When someone uses a device in a social setting, ask, “I see\nyou’re on your phone. Is everything OK?”\n• Chapter 35: Remove devices from your bedroom and have the internet\nautomatically turn off at a specific time.\"\n",

He informs Christ that he is no longer needed. His return is simply too great a threat to the Church. The Inquisitor tells Christ that the burden He laid on mankind—the burden of existence in faith and truth—was simply too great for mere mortals to bear. The Inquisitor claims that the Church, in its mercy, diluted that message, lifting the demand for perfect Being from the shoulders of its followers, providing them instead with the simple and merciful escapes of faith and the afterlife. That work took centuries, says the Inquisitor, and the last thing the Church needs after all that effort is the return of the Man who insisted that people bear all the weight in the first place.

That’s why it’s so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your “official” professional activity has ended.\n\n2. Take it slow. Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.\n\n3. Don’t fill your stomach. Less is more when it comes to eating for long life, too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.\n\n4. Surround yourself with good friends. Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.\n\n5. Get in shape for your next birthday. Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy.\n\n6. Smile. A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends. It’s good to recognize the things that aren’t so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.\n\n7. Reconnect with nature. Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often to recharge our batteries.\n\n8. Give thanks. To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every day giving thanks, and you’ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.\n\n9. Live in the moment. Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.\n\n10. Follow your ikigai. There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you don’t know what your ikigai is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to discover it.\"",

        "body": "Overfitting\n\nGet more data\t\nHaving more data gives the model more opportunities to learn patterns, patterns which may be more generalizable to new examples.\n\nSimplify your model\t\nIf the current model is already overfitting the training data, it may be too complicated of a model. This means it's learning the patterns of the data too well and isn't able to generalize well to unseen data. One way to simplify a model is to reduce the number of layers it uses or to reduce the number of hidden units in each layer.\n\nUse data augmentation\t\nData augmentation manipulates the training data in a way so that's harder for the model to learn as it artificially adds more variety to the data. If a model is able to learn patterns in augmented data, the model may be able to generalize better to unseen data.\n\nUse transfer learning\t\nTransfer learning involves leveraging the patterns (also called pretrained weights) one model has learned to use as the foundation for your own task. In our case, we could use one computer vision model pretrained on a large variety of images and then tweak it slightly to be more specialized for food images.\n\nUse dropout layers\t\nDropout layers randomly remove connections between hidden layers in neural networks, effectively simplifying a model but also making the remaining connections better. See torch.nn.Dropout() for more.\n\nUse learning rate decay\t\nThe idea here is to slowly decrease the learning rate as a model trains. This is akin to reaching for a coin at the back of a couch. The closer you get, the smaller your steps. The same with the learning rate, the closer you get to convergence, the smaller you'll want your weight updates to be.\n\nUse early stopping\t\nEarly stopping stops model training before it begins to overfit. As in, say the model's loss has stopped decreasing for the past 10 epochs (this number is arbitrary), you may want to stop the model training here and go with the model weights that had the lowest loss (10 epochs prior).\nThere are more methods for dealing with overfitting but these are some of the main ones.\n",

One way to add more predictive power to your model is to increase the number of hidden layers/units within those layers.\n\nTweak the learning rate\tPerhaps your model's learning rate is too high to begin with. And it's trying to update its weights each epoch too much, in turn not learning anything. In this case, you might lower the learning rate and see what happens.\n\nUse transfer learning\t\nTransfer learning is capable of preventing overfitting and underfitting. It involves using the patterns from a previously working model and adjusting them to your own problem.\n\nTrain for longer\t\nSometimes a model just needs more time to learn representations of data. If you find in your smaller experiments your model isn't learning anything, perhaps leaving it train for a more epochs may result in better performance.\n\nUse less regularization\t\nPerhaps your model is underfitting because you're trying to prevent overfitting too much.

        "body": "The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.  There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.\n\nIn computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in 1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler, search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective, these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said that  \"brute force\" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not.\n\nA similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning by self play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research. In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only much later was much greater success had by embracing search and learning.\n\nIn speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge---knowledge of words, of phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc. On the other side were newer methods that were more statistical in nature and did much more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Again, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics and computation came to dominate the field. The recent rise of deep learning in speech recognition is the most recent step in this consistent direction. Deep learning methods rely even less on human knowledge, and use even more computation, together with learning on huge training sets, to produce dramatically better speech recognition systems. As in the games, researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.\n\nIn computer vision, there has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived of vision as searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT features. But today all this is discarded. Modern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better.\n\nThis is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.\n\nOne thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.\n\nThe second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.\"",

Hold the line of the rear of the neck straight: instill vigour into your hairline, and in the same way from the shoulders down through your entire body. Lower both shoulders and, without the buttocks jutting out, put strength into your legs from the knees to the tips of your toes. Brace your abdomen so that you do not bend at the hips. Wedge your companion sword in your belt against your abdomen, so that your belt is not slack - this is called \"wedging in\". In all forms of strategy, it is necessary to maintain the combat stance in everyday life and to make your everyday stance your combat stance. You must research this well.\"",

        "body": "One technique for managing different hobbies is the “other significant other” (OSO), a phrase coined by relationship scientist Eli Finkel. Modern couples often assume they can get all of their needs met by their romantic partner. They expect this one person to wear many hats—in fact, almost all of the hats; hats that had been dispersed among our social network before we were married. Expecting our partners to fulfill all our needs puts a lot of\npressure on relationships. OSOs help alleviate that pressure. Think of it this way: If you try to pile dozens of hats on one person’s head, the pile (and maybe the person) will topple over. Instead, you can give the baseball cap to your sports-loving cousin and call her when you want to talk RBIs. You can give the cowboy hat to your friend who loves country music and make plans with him the next time you want a two-stepping partner. Research from social psychologists Elaine Cheung, Wendi\nGardner, and Jason Anderson supports this idea. They found that having multiple people you can turn to for emotional needs— rather than just one or two—leads to an increase in your overall well-being. For example, you might talk to your roommate when you’re angry and depend on your sister when you’re sad. When you’re in a relationship, here’s how you can incorporate\nOSOs into your life. Consider what roles you’ve asked your partner to play that they are uninterested in fulfilling: for example, insisting they go to a party with you when they much prefer smaller gatherings. Or wishing your partner would suggest visits to museums and art galleries when it’s just not their thing. Remember, just because they don’t share all your interests doesn’t make them a bad partner! And for those roles your partner isn’t suited for, find a friend or family member who can fill in. In the long run, this will make you happier because your needs are being met. And it will make your partner happier because they can focus on roles that match their skills and interests.\"",

When love and the false-consensus effect combine early in relationships, couples often fail to discuss important aspects of their future before they decide to get married. They assume they both want the same things without ever confirming that, which can lead to unhappy endings.\n3. Before you decide to tie the knot, you can override the falseconsensus effect by completing a series of self-reflection and partner activities called “It’s About Time: Past, Present, and Future.” You should have conversations about the past (where you’ve been), the present (where you are now), and the future (where you’re going).

But if the woodcutter stopped  after one or two strokes of his axe to ask the third son of Mr. Chang, “Why doesn’t this tree fall?” And after three or four more strokes stopped again to ask the fourth son of Mr. Li, “Why doesn’t this tree fall?” he would never succeed in felling the tree.

No acquisition works unless the people in the acquiring company respect the product, the markets, and the customers of the company they acquire. The acquisition must be a “temperamental fit. ”\n\n4. Within a year or so, the acquiring company must be able to provide top management for the company it acquires [in case the acquired managers decide to defect]. It is an elementary fallacy to believe one can “buy” management.\n\n5. Within the first year of a merger, it is important that a large number of people in the management groups of both companies receive substantial promotions across the lines—that is, from one of the former companies to the other.

I had always thought that when you need a job, you look online for job postings. And then you submit a dozen résumés. And then you hope that someone calls you back. If you’re lucky, maybe a friend puts your résumé at the top of the pile. If you’re qualified for a very high-demand profession, like accounting, maybe the job search comes a bit easier. But the rules are basically the same. The problem is, virtually everyone who plays by those rules fails. That week of interviews showed me that successful people are playing an entirely different game. They don’t flood the job market with résumés, hoping that some employer will grace them with an interview. They network. They email a friend of a friend to make sure their name gets the look it deserves. They have their uncles call old college buddies. They have their school’s career service office set up interviews months in advance on their behalf. They have parents tell them how to dress, what to say, and whom to schmooze. That doesn’t mean the strength of your résumé or interview performance is irrelevant. Those things certainly matter. But there is enormous value in what economists call social capital. It’s a professor’s term, but the concept is pretty simple: The networks of people and institutions around us have real economic value. They connect us to the right people, ensure that we have opportunities, and impart valuable information. Without them, we’re going it alone.\"",

        "title": "\"While there are no hard and fast rules for supporting someone through mental health problems, there are a few things that can help along the way.  1. When we focus on trying to fix the problem, it is easy to underestimate the power of simply being there. Most people don’t want to be told what to do. But they do want someone to keep showing up to check in and show they care.  2. If the loved one has a specific diagnosis, it can help to learn about how it affects them and get more specific advice on the challenges they are facing.  3. Don’t forget that the person you are supporting will have an idea of what they need. So asking them how they would like you to support them can help to give you guidance, while also communicating to them that you are listening.  4. Caring for someone can put a strain on your own mental health. But you cannot support them at your best if your mental health starts to deteriorate. So it is absolutely imperative that you prioritize your own health too – even in small ways. Keep a close eye on the basics. Keep track of your sleep, routine, nutritional intake, exercise and social contact.      5. Get your own support. Whether it be someone you trust, a support group or a professional, having a safe space to talk about your own feelings and think about how to move forward can help to stop you burning out.  6. Set boundaries. Supporting someone else does not mean that your life no longer matters. Geing clarity on your own values can help to keep you going when things get tough, but also to ensure that you can maintain some balance.  7. Work on a crisis plan. If the person you are caring for ever feels unsafe, then it is important to have a crisis plan. It doesn’t need to be complex. Acknowledge any early warning signs that things may be deteriorating and list the things that both of you can do to ensure everybody’s safety in that scenario. Having a written plan with all the numbers you need to call makes it easier to do what you need to in a crisis.  8. It is easy to underestimate the power of listening with compassion, kindness and curiosity. The problems may not disappear when you do that, but you are helping that person to feel cared for and less alone, which greatly improves their chances of recovery. Social support is a powerful tool and it does not need to come with all the answers, just a big dose of compassion.  9. Supporting someone does not mean that you have to connect with big, intense conversations. Human connection in the smallest of moments matters. Walking while you are talking can help those who feel uncomfortable with opening up. You can also say nothing at all. Simply spending time together, even in silence, is OK. By being there, you are helping them to feel less alone and more cared for.  10. If you are trying to help that person open up about their struggles, using open questions that ask for more than a yes or no answer can help. For example, rather than ‘Are you OK?’ try ‘What are you thinking?’  11. Listen carefully. Don’t oer advice unless they ask for it. Just reflect back what you hear them saying; let them know they are being heard and respected.  12. If that person talks about feeling hopeless or helpless, says that they cannot see a way out, or you become concerned about their safety, always seek professional advice.  13. Don’t underestimate the power of practical help. If someone is facing struggles with mental health, physical health, pre- and postnatal periods, or grief, all of these can make the usual day-to-day tasks more dicult. For example, helping someone to eat a few healthy meals each week by turning up with a home-made dinner is a great way to support a loved one.  14. Being sensitive to situations in which your loved one may feel especially vulnerable (or asking them if you don’t know) means that you can be there for them when they most need it. For example, if a loved one is recently bereaved and has to attend a social function alone for the first time, don’t avoid them. Lean in and show them love and kindness. Those situations will still be hard, but feeling less alone can mean everything.  15. It’s OK to change the subject. Being around someone does not mean you have to focus on their struggles the whole time. Distraction can be a welcome relief that they might find difficult to achieve when alone.  16. Have no expectations about their healing or recovery. It is never smooth and linear. There will be good days and bad days. Being surrounded by loved ones who are accepting of those ups and downs over the years will help them to do the same.  17. Be honest. If you want to be supportive but you are not sure how, say that out loud. Ask the person to let you know if you are saying or doing something that is not helpful. This openness allows everyone to feel less anxious and to truly connect, knowing that the situation is working for everyone.\"",

This is an exam that is more like an interview, in which you sit in front of a panel of experts and answer questions on your research. On the day of my exam I arrived at the university and entered the waiting room where we had to sit before we were called in. As I sat there listening to my heart pound, a fellow trainee returned to the waiting room with tears streaming down her face. She was sobbing as a member of staff put an arm around her shoulders and led her out of the waiting room. All remaining pairs of eyes in the waiting room widened and looked at each other in terror. Something jumped in all our stomachs. I stood up and moved out of the room, passing a tutor who wished me luck. Then he gave me one of the best pieces of advice I ever received. He told me to try and enjoy the exam. He told me that this was an opportunity to show off everything I had learned and worked on during these years of training. He said this was the one and only time that anyone would read the entirety of my thesis and show genuine interest in it, so it was my chance to enjoy sharing that interest. I returned the waiting room nodding and smiling. What I didn’t recognize until I was on safer ground was how he had helped me to reframe the entire experience. Nothing changed about the high-pressure situation I was facing. But I went from a rabbit in headlights to creating an experience that included a mix of courage, pleasure and excitement. In the same way that my viva exam was reframed from a risk to a challenge, you can use this same technique with other experiences that you might otherwise interpret as a threat or something you can’t cope with. Reframing does not mean that you deny the inherent risks in a given situation. There was still a risk of failing my exam. But if I chose to focus exclusively on that risk then my stress response might have been much higher and I probably would have found it much more difficult to perform. Reframing is when you allow yourself to consider reinterpreting the situation in a way that is going to help you move through it. Reframing an experience as a challenge can help us to shift from the flight urge to a somewhat more controlled fight urge. We can move towards something with intention.\"",

It’s worth noting that the aim when you are feeling overwhelmed with stress is not to go from agitated and worried to a relaxed and meditative state. When the world is demanding of us we want to be alert. As you use breathing techniques such as this one, you will notice that your mind’s ability to think more clearly and problem-solve becomes more available to you. In that sense, we are not trying to make it all go away and induce ultimate relaxation, but to put you in the best state possible in which you are able to use the advantages of the stress response (e.g. alertness) and bring down the intensity of the disadvantages (e.g. worry and overwhelm).\"",

The royal road to influence and power is to go the opposite direction: Put the focus on others. Let them do the talking. Let them be the stars of the show. Their opinions and values are worth emulating. The causes they support are the noblest. Such attention is so rare in this world, and people are so hungry for it, that giving them such validation will lower their defenses and open their minds to whatever ideas you want to insinuate. Your first move then is always to step back and assume an inferior position in relation to the other. Make it subtle. Ask for their advice. People are dying to impart their wisdom and experience. Once you feel that they are addicted to this attention, you can initiate a cycle of favors by doing something small for them, something that save them time or effort. They will instantly want to reciprocate and will return the favor without feeling manipulated or pushed. And once people do favors for you, they will continue to work on your behalf. In doing something for you, they have judged you worthy of this, and to stop helping you would mean to call into question their original judgment and their own intelligence, which people are very reluctant to do.

She will give him what he’s been missing in his prior relationships, whether that’s some wildness, some comfort and compassion, or a creative spark. Although he has had few actual encounters with the woman in question, he can imagine all kinds of positive experiences with her. The more he thinks of her, the more he’s certain he cannot live without her. When he talks of this perfect woman, you will notice there’s not a lot of concrete detail about what makes her so perfect. If he does manage to forge a relationship, he will quickly become disenchanted. She’s not who he thought she was; she misled him. He then moves on to the next woman to project his fantasy onto. This is a common form of male projection. It contains all of the elements he thinks he never got from his mother, never got from the other women in his life. This ideal mate will haunt his dreams. She will not appear to him in the form of someone he knows; she is a woman fashioned in his imagination—often young, elusive, but promising something great. In real life, certain types of women will tend to trigger this projection. She is usually quite hard to pin down and conforms to what Freud called the narcissistic woman—self-contained, not really needing a man or anybody to complete her. She can be a bit cold at the core and a blank screen upon which men can project whatever they want. Alternatively, she can seem to be a free spirit, full of creative energy but without a clear sense of her own identity. For men she serves as a muse, a great spark to their imagination, a lure to loosen up their own rigid mind when the boy becomes a man, he feels a great emptiness inside that he constantly needs to fill. He cannot exactly verbalize what he wants or what he missed, hence the vagueness of his fantasy. He will spend his life searching for this elusive figure and never settle on a fleshand-blood female. It’s always the next one who will be perfect. His own anima is a bit dreamy, introspective, and moody, which is the behavior he will tend to exhibit when in love. Men of this type must recognize the nature of their pattern. What they really need is to find and interact with a real woman, accept her inevitable flaws, and give more of themselves. They often prefer to chase their fantasy, because in such a scenario they are in control and have the freedom to leave when reality sets in. To break the pattern, such men will have to give up some of this control. When it comes to their need for a muse, they must learn to find such inspiration from within, to bring out more of the anima within themselves. They are too alienated from their own feminine spirit and need to loosen up their own thought processes. Not needing this wildness from their fantasy woman, they will better relate to the actual women in their life.\"",

They want things to be rather easy in life and tend to take the path of least resistance. They don’t have a stomach for protracted battles. They want money for the pleasures and comforts it can bring, for their yachts and mansions. They want to look powerful, to satisfy their ego.

You played out in your mind various scenes of future glory. This was a natural impulse on your part, and you felt no shame. Then, when you got older, you probably tried to stifle this. Either you kept your ambitions secret and acted modestly or you actually stopped dreaming altogether, trying to avoid seeming self-absorbed and being judged for this. Much of this sneering at ambition and ambitious people in our culture actually stems from a great deal of envy at the accomplishments of others. Tamping down your youthful ambitions is a sign that you don’t like or respect yourself; you no longer believe you deserve to have the power and recognition you once dreamed about. That doesn’t make you more adult, simply more likely to fail—by lowering your ambitions, you limit your possibilities and diminish your energy. In any event, in trying to appear unambitious, you are just as self-absorbed as anyone else; being so humble and saintly is your ambition, and you want to make a display of it.\"",

No mechanism could feel (and not merely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its successes, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made miserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed when it cannot get what it wants.\" This argument appears to be a denial of the validity of our test. According to the most extreme form of this view the only way by which one could be sure that machine thinks is to be the machine and to feel oneself thinking. One could then describe these feelings to the world, but of course no one would be justified in taking any notice. Likewise according to this view the only way to know that a man thinks is to be that particular man. It is in fact the solipsist point of view. It may be the most logical view to hold but it makes communication of ideas difficult. A is liable to believe \"A thinks but B does not\"  whilst B believes \"B thinks but A does not.\" instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.\"",

The prediction which we are considering is, however, rather nearer to practicability than that considered by Laplace. The system of the \"universe as a whole\" is such that quite small errors in the initial conditions can have an overwhelming effect at a later time. The displacement of a single electron by a billionth of a centimetre at one moment might make the difference between a man being killed by an avalanche a year later, or escaping. It is an essential property of the mechanical systems which we have called \"discrete-state machines\" that this phenomenon does not occur.

Even though our code deployments are fully automated, gems are not.\nProportional investment: Bennett—Automate gem management and installation into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment process.\n\nBonus—Why are we doing things in production on Friday nights?\nAnswer: Because no one says we can’t and it was a convenient time for the developer to prepare for a deployment we’d be doing on Monday.\nProportional investment: Tony—Make an announcement to the team. There will be no production changes on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday unless an exception has been made and approved by David (VP Engineering). We will reevaluate this policy when we have a fully automated continuous deployment process in place.\n\nAs a result of this Five Whys session and the proportional investments we made, our deployments are easier, quicker, and never again will our process allow a developer to place gems into production systems with unintended consequences.

Not such a remarkable finding, if you think about it, that people doing laundry wanted their detergent to help get their clothes not just clean, but very clean. So brands attempted to differentiate HOW they got your whites whiter and brights brighter by trying to convince consumers that one additive was more effective  than another. Protein, said one brand. Color enhancers, said another.  No one asked customers WHY they wanted their clothes clean. That little nugget wasn't revealed until many years later when a group of anthropologists hired by one of the packaged-goods companies revealed that all those additives weren't in fact driving behavior. They observed that when people took their washing out of the dryer, no one held it up to the light to see how white it was or compared it to newer items to see how bright it was. The first thing people did when they pulled their laundry out of the dryer was to smell it. This was an amazing discovery. Feeling clean was more important to people than being clean. There was a presumption that all detergents get your clothes clean. That's what detergent is supposed to do. But having their clothes smell fresh and clean mattered much  more than the nuanced differences between which detergent actually made clothes measurably cleaner. That a false assumption swayed an entire industry to follow the  wrong direction is not unique to detergents.\"",
